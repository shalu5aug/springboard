Whatsapp Chat Analysis using Regex and NLP
In this notebook I have done some analysis on the chat messages of one of my whatsapp group
Steps followed:
1.	Downloaded the chats in a text file and uploaded using OPEN file function
2.	Dates and messages are separated out using Regex with pattern 
'\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{2,4},\s\d{1,2}:\d{1,2}\s[A-Z]{2}'
3.	Data is now converted into  2 columns : Dates and messages
4.	Messages are now broken down into columns Users (who sent the message) and message using regex : 
pattern_user = '\s-\s*[A-Za-z]*\s*[A-Za-z]*'
pattern_msg = '\s-\s*[A-Za-z]*\s*[A-Za-z]*:'
5.	Now final data is into 3 columns : Dates, User and Messages
6.	Month is extracted using date function to do month wise analysis
