9/21/20, 10:21 AM - Vibhu: Padam, did you order the milk from Costco (when you see higher prices) through instacart or through sameday Costco?
9/21/20, 10:21 AM - Vibhu: The prices should be same as store if you order from sameday Costco rather than going through instacart
9/21/20, 10:22 AM - Padam Jain: Instacart. Will try same day

9/21/20, 10:24 AM - Padam Jain: Actually, it won't fit me but that can be a good motivation
9/21/20, 10:36 AM - Ashu: I think sameday does add some margin but probably not as much as going through instacart.

9/27/20, 12:30 PM - Ashu: (GPS) receivers can also determine altitude by trilateration with four or more satellites. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altimeter
9/27/20, 12:32 PM - Ashu: IPhone also has barometric sensors for determining altitude. Just install a barometer/altitude app. 

https://www.extremestorms.com/iphone_6_barometer.htm
9/27/20, 12:33 PM - Padam Jain: In hiking and climbing, it is common to find that the altitude measured by GPS is off by as much as 400 feet (122 metres) depending on satellite orientation.[10]
9/27/20, 12:34 PM - Padam Jain: That's 40% error in our today's hike 😀
9/27/20, 12:34 PM - Ashu: lol 
Question was if satellite signal has z or not
9/27/20, 12:36 PM - Ashu: And Apple Watch apparently has had an altimeter since series 3

9/27/20, 3:38 PM - Ashu: @15183204050 insole inserts superfeet?
9/27/20, 3:40 PM - Sumit: I have a north face hiking shoe with 10.5 size if you want to try.

9/27/20, 10:24 PM - Sumit: Yes
9/27/20, 10:25 PM - Vibhu: Earth quake Insurance should go higher tomorrow

10/1/20, 10:12 PM - Vibhu: yeah looks like he is tested positive .. 17 mins earlier
10/1/20, 10:12 PM - Vibhu: hope hick news was from few hours before when his tests were awaited

10/1/20, 10:13 PM - Vibhu: atleast he cant refute now the danger of corona
10/1/20, 10:13 PM - Vibhu: and he can drink bleach
10/1/20, 10:13 PM - Vibhu: or hydroxy chloro quinine
10/1/20, 10:13 PM - Ashu: Nah just some bleach and hydroxy chloroquine
10/1/20, 10:13 PM - Ashu: Yeah 
Biden won’t be able to debate him again
10/1/20, 10:14 PM - Rashi: Oh no! 180 min of comedy
10/1/20, 10:14 PM - Vibhu: the big thing will be if he dies
10/1/20, 10:14 PM - Vibhu: pence becomes president
10/1/20, 10:14 PM - Ashu: That’s probably worse
10/1/20, 10:14 PM - Vibhu: and now the election is between pence and vp choice
10/1/20, 10:14 PM - Vibhu: biden will lose for sure
10/1/20, 10:14 PM - Rashi: But Biden can win pence easily?

10/1/20, 10:19 PM - Ashu: Drop
10/1/20, 10:19 PM - Vibhu: May be that’s his strategy to get the vaccine before election 😛
10/1/20, 10:19 PM - Vibhu: Or show that there is vaccine and it works
10/1/20, 10:20 PM - Vibhu: By faking corona to him and her
10/1/20, 10:20 PM - Ashu: - avoid debate
- get vaccine fast tracked 
- become hero being attacked by Chinese virus

10/1/20, 10:56 PM - Ashu: And Biden
10/1/20, 10:57 PM - Ashu: Interesting analysis 
There’s a scenario when even if Biden wins and if dies, then Republicans can choose the president 

Not sure how legally true though

So yeah 2 weeks time until huge speech/rally.

10/5/20, 2:36 PM - Sumit: Lohe ko loha kaat ta hai. Someone should have floated the conspiracy theory that trump never had covid. This victory lap from trump was obviously expected and there was no startegy to counter it. Keeping the status quo would only work in a rational ‘world’.
10/5/20, 2:37 PM - Ashu: Democrats: when they go low, we go high

Probably US residents first incl overseas armed forces 
Then ship left over vaccine stock to other countries

वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो
चाय का मजा रहे, 
पकौड़ी से सजा रहे
मुंह कभी रुके नहीं, 
रजाई कभी उठे नहीं
वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो
मां की लताड़ हो 
बाप की दहाड़ हो
तुम निडर डटो वहीं,
रजाई से उठो नहीं
वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो ||
मुंह गरजते रहे, 
डंडे भी बरसते रहे
दीदी भी भड़क उठे,
चप्पल भी खड़क उठे
वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो
प्रात हो कि रात हो, 
संग कोई न साथ हो
रजाई में घुसे रहो, 
तुम वही डटे रहो
वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो
एक रजाई लिए हुए 
एक प्रण किए हुए
अपने आराम के लिए,
सिर्फ आराम के लिए
वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो
कमरा ठंड से भरा, 
कान गालीयों से भरे
यत्न कर निकाल लो,
ये समय निकाल लो
ठंड है ये ठंड है, 
यह बड़ी प्रचंड है
हवा भी चला रही, 
धूप को डरा रही
वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो।।

12/27/20, 6:54 PM - Ashu: I am considering YouTube premium subscription; can add on people on family plan. 
Ad free and offline playback. 

Can’t justify to myself if only 1-2 people use it. 
I am sure viraj would like it. 
Anaya?
12/27/20, 7:15 PM - Padam Jain: Anaya uses it heavily

12/29/20, 7:09 PM - Padam Jain: I have started a 16:8 fasting . No wheat, rice, pasta, potatoes. I might end up going on keto with that.
12/29/20, 7:10 PM - Ashu: 👍🏻
You have *lots* of company in this group
12/29/20, 7:11 PM - Padam Jain: Good. We can have a keto feast in a couple of weeks.

1/6/21, 6:59 PM - Vibhu: Googlers- I need help. Can you ask around or post in your internal channels to seek answer for below. 

I have account 2mailvibhu@gmail.com which is delegated to my primary account Vibhu.jindal@gmail.com
 
I forgot the password and trying to recover 2mailvibhu@gmail. It’s a two step process 
Step 1: Answer the question. I am hundred and ten percent sure that it is the right answer 
Step 2: put recover email Id which I did Vibhu.jindal 

It send OTP which I am putting as next step. 

After that in get stuck -it says unfortunately Google couldn’t verify that this account belongs to you. 
All my emails from 2mailvibhu are forwarded to Vibhu.Jindal so I am not sure why they can’t verify 

Any help or what can be done further or is it a lost cause ?
1/6/21, 7:06 PM - Padam Jain: https://sites.google.com/view/gooogle-live-person/home
1/6/21, 7:13 PM - Vibhu: no option in help center (https://support.google.com/) to call or chat as they tell in help center
1/6/21, 7:14 PM - Vibhu: what am i missing ?
1/6/21, 7:24 PM - Ashu: If you don’t have a backup email set it’s most likely a lost cause
1/6/21, 7:24 PM - Vibhu: I have a back up email set which is also delegated account Vibhu.jindal@gmail
1/6/21, 7:27 PM - Ashu: Try here maybe 
https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/43548977?hl=en
1/6/21, 7:28 PM - Vibhu: Tried .. that’s where it said google can’t verify your account
1/6/21, 7:29 PM - Vibhu: I am getting all emails from 2mailvibhu but fear of google might make the account non operational due to no activity and hence thought to login (and forgot the password)
1/6/21, 7:30 PM - Ashu: Just move your accounts to new email while it’s still forwarding
1/6/21, 7:32 PM - Vibhu: Yeah that’s the last resort but thought to ask if any other option to revive

Microsoft health vault shut down now.
1/7/21, 1:00 PM - Vibhu: Was looking more for scanned and pdfs on annuals, tests, case data, lipids/ bloodwork.
I checked out health one but they don’t allow uploads. Haven’t tried labcorp- do they help to upload results /pdfs and organize ?
1/7/21, 1:01 PM - Ashu: It connects digitally
1/7/21, 1:01 PM - Ashu: <Media omitted>
1/7/21, 1:02 PM - Vibhu: How did it got the digital data ?
1/7/21, 1:02 PM - Ashu: Only last two years with labcorp
AZ was sonora quest that’s not available in Apple connection
1/7/21, 1:02 PM - Ashu: This
1/7/21, 1:03 PM - Vibhu: Sorry didn’t get it  .. but how Apple health would know cholesterol
1/7/21, 1:03 PM - Ashu: Connects to labcorp in app
1/7/21, 1:03 PM - Vibhu: Ok then how labCorp got it ?
1/7/21, 1:04 PM - Vibhu: Did annual blood work done at labcorps ?
1/7/21, 1:04 PM - Ashu: If they are the ones doing testing obviously 
And you make your account on labcorp then connect to Apple app with that login password
1/7/21, 1:05 PM - Vibhu: Ok yeah that’s not the case. The testing facility keeps on changing
1/7/21, 1:05 PM - Ashu: This is why only 2 years data
Earlier is with different provider than labcorp
1/7/21, 1:05 PM - Vibhu: That’s why need to consolidate
1/7/21, 1:05 PM - Ashu: It’s a start 
I think Apple health will add more connections in future
1/7/21, 1:06 PM - Ashu: Who’s your labs provider? 
Is it in Apple health connections?
1/7/21, 1:06 PM - Vibhu: My office does the annual blood and lipid test on site
1/7/21, 1:06 PM - Vibhu: Else quest or others — keeps changing
1/7/21, 1:07 PM - Ashu: Quest diagnostics is an available connection 
At least add that data
1/7/21, 1:08 PM - Vibhu: Ok

1/7/21, 1:26 PM - Rashi: I am procrastinating a lot
1/7/21, 1:32 PM - Ashu: 🤣
Well to be fair, most of this is from a 2500 ft house
1/7/21, 1:33 PM - Ashu: If you have your use conditions ready I can help code them
But only you can observe your patterns and determine the use conditions
1/7/21, 1:34 PM - Padam Jain: This sounds like it is a matrix dialogue.
1/7/21, 1:34 PM - Padam Jain: Very philosophical

You have to walk through it yourself
1/7/21, 1:36 PM - Rashi: My bedroom light still works but also speaks out an error which I couldn’t fix. May be can start from there and then move to moving everything to HomeKit
1/7/21, 1:37 PM - Ashu: Did you try the solution I recommended last time?
1/7/21, 1:37 PM - Rashi: Yes and it didn’t solve
1/7/21, 1:38 PM - Rashi: I am worried to unlink lights. As last time it may fail to reconnect
1/7/21, 1:38 PM - Rashi: But unlinking smarthings app didn’t thelo
1/7/21, 1:38 PM - Rashi: Help
1/7/21, 1:39 PM - Ashu: SmartThings is 95% reliable 
HomeKit is 99.9%

Homebridge to connect the two is only as reliable as SmartThings 
So you will want to spend time tinkering
1/7/21, 1:40 PM - Rashi: Yea raspi is in the house. Time to open the bag and start screwing it up 😂

1/7/21, 1:40 PM - Ashu: I only recommend HomeKit or wifi based devices nowadays

1/14/21, 2:23 PM - Vibhu: i and my brothers family will be buying tablet for the kids (they already have laptop)
1/14/21, 2:23 PM - Padam Jain: Tablet market has saturated for a reason
1/14/21, 2:23 PM - Sumit: The way market demand is currently everyone is struggling to procure parts and secure capacity for whole of 2021. I think this will persist beyond 2021 as post pandemic era will take little longer given the speed of vaccination.
1/14/21, 2:23 PM - Vibhu: so dell and lenovo should rise

3/22/21, 5:22 PM - Ashu: Wait 
Are you recommending a trip to AZ now that JnJ vaccine is 79% effective
3/22/21, 5:27 PM - Padam Jain: I am in. Vibhu can hike to AZ

Definitely let’s go to AZ asap!!
3/23/21, 3:11 PM - Vibhu: Intel announced - two fabs in AZ, next chip at TSMC and $20B spend
3/23/21, 3:37 PM - Sumit: Looks like there is wave of businesses moving to Texas and Arizona. I seem to be always moving in the opposite direction 🤪
3/23/21, 3:45 PM - Ashu: Yeah
Let’s move back?
3/23/21, 4:30 PM - Padam Jain: My house is up for rent in June there. Let me know.

3/23/21, 6:11 PM - Rashi: I should get one fir garage
3/23/21, 6:11 PM - Padam Jain: People in China might be sharing it 😀
3/23/21, 6:11 PM - Ashu: It looks outside 
More security if many people looking at it 🤣
3/23/21, 6:12 PM - Ashu: But yeah

3/25/21, 11:47 AM - Vibhu: But how will one get the appointment unless they increase the delivery capacity
3/25/21, 11:47 AM - Ashu: It says ‘eligibility’ not vaccination 
🤣
3/25/21, 11:48 AM - Ashu: With all healthcare agencies free to schedule, now the bottleneck will be vaccine supply and non delivery capacity
3/25/21, 12:09 PM - Padam Jain: Newsome is going crazy now with recall over his head
3/25/21, 12:26 PM - Rashi: June 15 th as I predicted :)
3/25/21, 12:32 PM - Padam Jain: Anyone up for hike tomorrow am?
3/25/21, 12:58 PM - Ashu: Vibhu will be outlier
3/25/21, 1:03 PM - Rashi: He is not in my data set 😂

3/29/21, 10:46 AM - Rashi: Please don’t send deals.. please send the donuts 😂
3/29/21, 10:46 AM - Rashi: Too much guilt to go and buy
3/29/21, 10:46 AM - Rashi: Easier to eat if they are in front of you :)
3/29/21, 10:50 AM - Ashu: If you promise to eat, Vibhu will definitely bring a dozen to you
3/29/21, 11:48 AM - Rashi: I can promise to eat 1. But I am no where near his motivation to get anything
3/29/21, 12:01 PM - Ashu: For 1 donut? probably not lol
3/29/21, 12:37 PM - Ashu: It’s only 190 calories 
You can easily eat 3-4 donuts per day all week and go snowboarding on weekend
3/29/21, 12:46 PM - Rashi: Laa rahe ho to batao.. :)
3/29/21, 12:47 PM - Ashu: Kha rahe ho to batao.. :)
3-4 and at least 2 in one go
3/29/21, 12:52 PM - Rashi: Haha I can agree to 2 if they are fresh :) 
Usse zyada to bohot zyada guilt hoga

3/29/21, 4:47 PM - Sumit: Where and when is this party??
3/29/21, 5:35 PM - Rashi: Pani poori will be ready tomorrow! Kal hi kar lete hain.. Ashu krispy tomorrow?
3/29/21, 5:38 PM - Ashu: Next Monday? At least I can get a free donut while picking up from krispy kreme lol
3/29/21, 5:43 PM - Rashi: Haha works fir me. Cant guarantee pani poori then 😂

3/29/21, 7:12 PM - Rashi: only if i had counter space, this would have bought.. 510 isnt bad as it will grind and brew
3/29/21, 7:13 PM - Ashu: Expand your kitchen, remove that wall 😛
3/29/21, 10:34 PM - Ashu: Anyone has experience with kindle models? What’s a good one for reading at night, and in direct sunshine during day ?
3/29/21, 10:35 PM - Ashu: e ink displays are supposed to look like paper, and absence of glare means less stress on eyes
3/29/21, 10:41 PM - Vibhu: Sumit batao 😝
3/30/21, 8:33 AM - Sumit: no experience in using kindles but best is Kindle Oasis .. adaptive light adjustment and warm light feature but it's expensive. If you can pay for apple watch just to keep a count on your calories then Kindle Oasis is probably worth buying 😜 😂
3/30/21, 8:34 AM - Ashu: 😭
I am being roasted for calories burning (lack of)
🤣😛
And getting influenced to contribute to amzn stock now
😊
3/30/21, 8:46 AM - Rashi: Use iPad 😂
3/30/21, 5:06 PM - Ashu: It’s still not usb-c 😠
3/30/21, 5:06 PM - Ashu: It’s still not usb-c 😛
3/30/21, 5:07 PM - Rashi: Why do you need usbc to read a book 🙄
3/30/21, 5:07 PM - Ashu: I don’t want to carry all different types of chargers while traveling
3/30/21, 5:08 PM - Rashi: I don’t think usbc will be universal point.
3/30/21, 5:08 PM - Rashi: Btw iPad Pro is usbc
3/30/21, 5:08 PM - Ashu: I can buy half a library in that much 😜
3/30/21, 5:08 PM - Rashi: Stay in Apple ecosystem. All you need is two adapters and can skip a few with wireless charging :)
3/30/21, 5:09 PM - Rashi: 😂
3/30/21, 5:09 PM - Sumit: But ipad is not good for reading 😛
3/30/21, 5:09 PM - Rashi: Oh well aankhein theek karwa lo 😂
3/30/21, 5:09 PM - Rashi: Bada competition hone wala hai is group par lagta hai 😂😂😂
3/30/21, 5:09 PM - Sumit: Hahaha
3/30/21, 5:10 PM - Rashi: You can carry multiple gadgets but don’t want to carry two pieces of charger. Interesting
3/30/21, 5:10 PM - Ashu: Yeah peeps need to buy some Pixel phones and Chromebooks and Google routers now ...
3/30/21, 5:11 PM - Sumit: 😂
3/30/21, 5:11 PM - Rashi: I have minimized my chargers by getting 60w two port usbc chargers. One for iPad and other for phone/watch together :)
3/30/21, 5:12 PM - Rashi: Satisfaction kaha se laoge 😜
3/30/21, 5:12 PM - Ashu: satisfaction comes from supporting your Jain friends lol
3/30/21, 5:12 PM - Rashi: 😂

3/30/21, 5:14 PM - Rashi: 😂👍
3/30/21, 5:14 PM - Sumit: We will need to fight two googlers but I know Rashi can take them down alone 😛😁
3/30/21, 5:14 PM - Rashi: Yea!!!!! I want to say girl power but we all know whose power 😂
3/30/21, 5:15 PM - Rashi: Make him delay his sanyas plan for two years so that he joins there and we make fun of him
3/30/21, 5:15 PM - Rashi: While he bores us with his arguments to death and then we all give up
3/30/21, 5:16 PM - Ashu: yeah, he needs to work for a millennial company like FB; and not retire early
3/30/21, 5:16 PM - Rashi: Eggjactly
3/30/21, 5:16 PM - Ashu: And FB is indeed a software company, right? :P
3/30/21, 5:16 PM - Rashi: 😂
3/30/21, 5:16 PM - Rashi: Well he may come back and say it is not
3/30/21, 5:17 PM - Ashu: yeah, us old people do not understand him
he needs the FB crowd
3/30/21, 5:17 PM - Ashu: or Msft Holo lens crowd
3/30/21, 5:29 PM - Rashi: Chalein?

https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/contra-costa-county-now-has-covid-19-vaccine-appointments-for-all-adults/
3/30/21, 5:34 PM - Ashu: If there are appointments, can consider 
It’s an hour or so drive
3/30/21, 5:37 PM - Rashi: I just went to website and filled in online form
3/30/21, 5:37 PM - Rashi: Cchealth.org/coronavirus
3/30/21, 5:37 PM - Rashi: They will contact
3/30/21, 5:37 PM - Ashu: Are they open for non residents?
3/30/21, 5:37 PM - Rashi: Let’s see what happens
3/30/21, 5:38 PM - Rashi: Form didn’t ask for residency
3/30/21, 5:38 PM - Rashi: Fill it out. Doesn’t harm I think
3/30/21, 5:38 PM - Ashu: They will ask at appointment
3/30/21, 5:38 PM - Ashu: Contra Costa Health Services (CCHS) encourages everyone who lives or works in the county age 16 or older to request an appointment
3/30/21, 5:38 PM - Rashi: They asked for address. Hopefully that will filter it out
3/30/21, 5:39 PM - Rashi: Line mei lag gayi hoo. Baki dekhte hain 😂
3/30/21, 5:39 PM - Ashu: 👍😀
3/30/21, 5:39 PM - Rashi: I am sure they won’t return me if I get appointment. They won’t waste the 🧪
3/30/21, 5:45 PM - Ashu: We are paying the price of living in Silicon Valley (Santa Clara county) in multiple ways 😕
3/30/21, 6:29 PM - Ashu: <Media omitted>
3/30/21, 6:47 PM - Sumit: Apparently people are just filling in the form that they are working in the food industry even though they are not. No one is asking for proof when you reach at the site for vaccination. So there is lot of fraud going on to get ahead in the line.
3/30/21, 7:50 PM - Rashi: That’s sad actually. The people who actually need it are not getting it then or getting delayed

4/1/21, 6:00 PM - Rashi: It goes back to Vibhu’s argument the other day!
4/1/21, 6:01 PM - Padam Jain: Hmmm, Mac OS, IOS 🤔
4/1/21, 6:07 PM - Ashu: 🤣
4/5/21, 11:37 AM - Vibhu: Looks like Apple CEO changing
4/5/21, 6:53 PM - Ashu: Hot donuts, anyone?

That reminds me I forgot to pick the half donut on my way out 😭
4/5/21, 9:50 PM - Rashi: I have to hide the box. Both of you left it here 😭
4/5/21, 9:51 PM - Rashi: Buy it and do a side by side comparison with iPad. And then let me know when you want to buy the iPad 😂
4/5/21, 9:52 PM - Ashu: Are you gifting me iPad for side by side testing?
Pls gift the most expensive one
4/5/21, 9:52 PM - Rashi: I am offering you mine to try out for side by side :)
4/5/21, 9:52 PM - Rashi: Though mine is not the best
4/5/21, 9:53 PM - Ashu: Nah I need to test for at least a year or two
4/5/21, 9:53 PM - Rashi: 😱
4/5/21, 9:53 PM - Rashi: Is that how slow the response is of Boox

5/2/21, 4:19 PM - Sumit: Hi All,
As you know the situation in India is worsening day by day due to lack of medical supplies. We are organizing a fundraising campaign to purchase critical medical devices like Oxygen Concentrators, Ventilators and BiPAP machines to help India fight the severe second wave of COVID-19. Our goal is to raise $250,000 to procure and install 200 such devices to hospitals that need it most across India.
We request your support and contribution in any way you can to help us meet our goal. Here’s the link to our campaign where you can find additional details and donate - https://www.facebook.com/donate/132324645584278/.
We are directly working with the suppliers and the volunteers on the ground in India for both procurement and deployment. You can be assured that the donated money will be used for the right purposes. Thank you for your time and consideration, highly appreciate your support!

5/2/21, 7:55 PM - Sumit: We are buying equipments directly from a china source (through a wharton colleague’s acquaintance). SEWA will distribute those. If they are doing fraud in distribution or selling in black market then it’s definitely concerning.
5/2/21, 8:09 PM - Padam Jain: That's awesome. You should highlight this on your page that you are doing direct buy because I am sure there are lot of people like me always suspicious about career non profits. Get some check on which hospitals are getting these Ventilators and criterion that they are using for the ones they have already shipped.
5/2/21, 8:10 PM - Sumit: Yup already looking to make this changes on the page. That’s a good suggestion.
5/3/21, 3:02 PM - Vibhu: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/05/03/tech/bill-and-melinda-gates-divorce/index.html
5/3/21, 3:50 PM - Sumit: Please help to share it in your IIT and other whatsapp group as well.
5/4/21, 11:35 AM - Ashu: Do check with your employer programs, they have 1-1 match resulting in doubling the donation as well.
5/4/21, 12:04 PM - Rashi: Yes we have 2-1. Already got that registered
5/4/21, 5:01 PM - Sumit: <Media omitted>
5/4/21, 5:01 PM - Sumit: Is this Rashi? Ganesh found this photo and asking
5/4/21, 5:09 PM - Vibhu: No
5/4/21, 5:09 PM - Vibhu: Tell Ganesh to meet us often as he has forgotten how rashi looks
5/4/21, 5:11 PM - Vibhu: Though I am bit worried about you. We just met yesterday evening and you still asking if this is rashi 🤪
5/4/21, 5:12 PM - Sumit: 😂 I told Ganesh Rashi has a good look-alike 😛
5/4/21, 5:13 PM - Vibhu: “Good” - so are you saying rashi is worse looking than her doppelgänger in photo
5/4/21, 5:30 PM - Rashi: You guys can take my looks discussion elsewhere 😡
5/4/21, 5:32 PM - Ashu: 🤣
5/4/21, 5:32 PM - Ashu: What tool is that?
5/4/21, 5:35 PM - Rashi: Ye dekho ek aur aaye. 
Ek ko maein rashi lag rahi hoo
Doosre ko dono ladkiyon ke naam yaad hai. Jinhe dekh abhi nahi
And teesra.. interested in tools 🤦‍♀️
5/4/21, 5:45 PM - Sumit: After effects of crossing 40s 😜
5/4/21, 5:46 PM - Rashi: Haha 
Achha hai
I am getting younger after crossing 40 😉
5/4/21, 5:47 PM - Sumit: Looks like Vibhu is hallucinating on fictional people who no one knows 😂
5/4/21, 5:47 PM - Rashi: 😂😂

5/5/21, 12:55 PM - Ashu: 👍👏
5/5/21, 12:55 PM - Padam Jain: Btw, is that Rashi's grad school pic?
5/5/21, 3:42 PM - Rashi: <Media omitted>
5/5/21, 5:14 PM - Ashu: So you at least know what tool is this one?
5/5/21, 8:43 PM - Padam Jain: Sumit, one thought. Since you have found a supplier for oxygen concentrator etc. would it make more sense to establish a not for profit supply chain for a recurring supply of these thing rather than making it one time event. I think problem is the short supply rather than money at this point there.
5/5/21, 9:40 PM - Sumit: I don't think we are looking to make it one time event. As long as donations keep coming we will continue to get devices from the supplier and deliver to India. I believe the challenge for us currently is to have enough funds and keep it growing so we can go longer.  I talked to few other suppliers in US as well. I didn't hear any major shortage issue. SEWA is also procuring from few suppliers in US and shipping to India. It's a matter of mobilizing funds faster to deliver rather than supply constraint at this time since India is at the peak of cases/deaths currently.
5/5/21, 9:43 PM - Sumit: please continue to forward to your contacts and urge them to donate if they haven't yet to any other campaign.
5/5/21, 9:54 PM - Sumit: some of these devices are pretty expensive.. ranges from $500 (oxygen concentrators) to $8000-$13000 (ventilators) so funds become crucial as well.
5/6/21, 9:45 AM - Vibhu: As I understand supply of oxygen concentrators are not that big of problem currently (for people who can afford it). 
Timelines,  distribution (in time) is.
5/6/21, 9:45 AM - Vibhu: There are lot of efforts where one can procure and secure

5/6/21, 9:50 AM - Padam Jain: I was just talking in India. Same thing what you are saying. Available for about INR 90k. Oxygen doesn't seem to be an issue atleast in Jaipur and in Government hospitals as govt is priortizing them
5/6/21, 9:51 AM - Padam Jain: One of my cousin just got admitted from a small town  to Jaipur and got oxygen immediately
5/6/21, 10:30 PM - Ashu: When do you leave for Alaska?

5/18/21, 4:00 PM - Ashu: New automation: smart plug power meter connected to coffee machine
when it detects >1kw power, after xx minutes it notifies me coffee is ready
xx = time to heat up, brew coffee, few minutes to cool down to be ready to drink
So just walk to coffee machine, punch in, walk away and I get notification when I can pick coffee and start drinking ...
5/18/21, 4:03 PM - Ashu: Next step: automate start
proving to be bit too much for plug n play devices ... and integrated machines are 10x the cost ...
5/18/21, 4:08 PM - Padam Jain: How about adding a tube from coffee machine to your desk?

5/21/21, 2:42 PM - Rashi: Do you have any suggestions? Haven’t dined out in a very long time.
5/21/21, 2:43 PM - Ashu: Let me propose a place, since I have more restrictions (outdoor seating)
5/21/21, 2:43 PM - Ashu: What time?
Sat evening is prime time so need a place without reservation preferably to avoid crowd
5/21/21, 2:45 PM - Ashu: And any preferences

5/30/21, 2:19 PM - Ashu: RSUs are treated as supplemental income. Many companies withhold federal income taxes on RSUs at a flat rate of 22% (37% for amount over $1 million). The 22% doesn’t include state income, Social Security, and Medicare tax withholding. For people working in California, the total tax withholding on your RSUs are actually around 40%. If your marginal federal income tax bracket is higher than 22% excluding RSUs, you are most likely not withholding enough. You need to either increase withholding amount from each paycheck by adjusting your W-4 if possible or make quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid a potential penalty for underpayment of estimated tax.

7/15/21, 1:52 PM - Ashu: nooooo 
You didnt say this before I moved .....
7/15/21, 1:52 PM - Rashi: I looked at reviews, and opening time as well.. not just a search
7/15/21, 1:52 PM - Rashi: thats why engineers need PM
7/15/21, 1:52 PM - Rashi: Engineers cannot do a simple thing right
7/15/21, 1:52 PM - Vibhu: Exactly .. we are destined for bigger objectives  -  doing complex things right
7/15/21, 1:53 PM - Vibhu: We need PM for simpler things
7/15/21, 1:53 PM - Rashi: yea making simple things complex is what engineers do
7/15/21, 1:53 PM - Rashi: and then PM sits and simplifies it
7/15/21, 1:53 PM - Ashu: 🤣
7/15/21, 1:56 PM - Vibhu: If you ask a MasterChef  to give you pasta, he will give homemade tagliolini with blueberry flavored truffles on side with hint of Rosemary

7/15/21, 1:57 PM - Rashi: see complex
7/15/21, 1:57 PM - Rashi: and then PM will go and set the menu to say "it is pasta"
7/15/21, 1:58 PM - Vibhu: Still better than these sourcing guys 🙂 - they will put wheat, water and egg on the menu
7/15/21, 1:59 PM - Rashi: yucks!
7/15/21, 1:59 PM - Rashi: yea for sure PM>engineer>GSM
7/15/21, 2:00 PM - Rashi: basically the BOM 😂
7/15/21, 2:00 PM - Rashi: and engineers come up with fancy names to attract crowd
7/15/21, 2:01 PM - Rashi: and PM works to sell it by making it sound simple but keeping the complexity
7/15/21, 2:01 PM - Rashi: i should be in marketing
7/15/21, 2:50 PM - Ashu: When will this PM-BizDev duo actually finish the required task? :P
7/15/21, 2:51 PM - Ashu: Sourcing doesnt sell. You skipped Manufacturing, marketing and sales altogether ... never let your sourcing guy sell for you ... horrible at sales
7/15/21, 3:40 PM - Ashu: https://on.mktw.net/3ievmRI Check out this article from MarketWatch - Intel explores deal to buy chip maker GlobalFoundries for around $30 billion

7/15/21, 4:40 PM - Rashi: 😭
7/15/21, 4:40 PM - Rashi: And you can tell me if I should drink on everyone’s behalf.. can definitely do that 😂
7/15/21, 7:22 PM - Ashu: Nah, just pay on everyone’s behalf 😜🤣🤣
7/15/21, 7:22 PM - Rashi: <Media omitted>

7/16/21, 8:53 AM - Padam Jain: Rashi, you escaped being Intel employee again if you had stayed at GF
7/16/21, 9:08 AM - Ashu: Did this get answered? :P
7/16/21, 9:10 AM - Padam Jain: Haha, we all are seasoned meeting ratholers
7/16/21, 9:13 AM - Ashu: How about BJ's brewery at Westfield Oakridge? Good beer, full bar options. It is close-by for everyone as well.
Only drawback would be crowds on Fri 8.30pm / seating availability
7/16/21, 9:13 AM - Padam Jain: Parking will be an issue too there
7/16/21, 9:14 AM - Padam Jain: Definitely will be long wait
7/16/21, 9:14 AM - Padam Jain: Dinner/drinks Same place or different?
7/16/21, 9:16 AM - Ashu: Oh you are looking at dinner + drinks at 8.30pm? I thought it was for drink; and someone proposed dinner at 7
7/16/21, 9:17 AM - Padam Jain: Yeh, not sure what the final plan is. I can meet for dinner too
7/16/21, 9:27 AM - Rashi: I know! I feel for people who left GF for Intel 😂😂

7/16/21, 9:30 AM - Rashi: Uff! Pm has to even take decisions for engineers 🤦‍♀️
7/16/21, 9:30 AM - Rashi: This was so typical of an engineer.. to go for an option outside of options 😂
7/16/21, 9:48 AM - Ashu: Engg - Give clear spec (Is it drinks or dinner + drinks)
PM - Conclude on ONE option that is acceptable to all after getting all inputs on constraints (and set up calendar invite :P)
7/16/21, 9:50 AM - Padam Jain: Engg. wants to know the deadline. 6:59pm to make the call?
7/16/21, 9:55 AM - Rashi: Calendar invite is you thing 🤷‍♀️ 😂
I have provided option .. looks like pm has to do downselection too. We should fire all engineers 👩‍💻 
Let’s meet at district San Jose at 7pm tonight :)

7/16/21, 9:57 AM - Rashi: Seriously. All of you engineers are fired
7/16/21, 9:58 AM - Rashi: Only biz dev and pm survive
7/16/21, 9:58 AM - Rashi: Biz dev just do mostly talking but still entertains all 😂
7/16/21, 9:58 AM - Ashu: calendar is a PM thing btw

7/25/21, 10:54 AM - Vibhu: I second that. 
Sumit is no more a college student and Padam is father of two now - so 💯 old. I was forever young so relative comparison doesn’t hold. 

Ashu definitely seems younger. I wonder what changed.

So did Vibhu 
Everyone else lost weight

7/25/21, 12:01 PM - Vibhu: So do we have to think  out of box to guess ?
Like how many boxes ? - 2 kgs- go figure out how many it will be
7/25/21, 12:21 PM - Ashu: You will be shown pictures from the move. And of the folded boxes.

8/6/21, 10:50 AM - Ashu: Question on water softener - It is costing more for plumbing to create the loop than the water softener itself ... 
Is it better to just put a RO unit for drinking water instead?
8/6/21, 10:54 AM - Vibhu: Yes. Based on where and how plumbing would be done. Softeners with filters by itself will cost 800-1000$
8/6/21, 10:57 AM - Vibhu: If it is old house and old plumbing then they will recommend you change all underneath plumbing. You can take risk and not get changed everything. 

The water coming from county is good for drinking. The problem is that it will leave salt residues on dishware, bathroom, body, pretty much everywhere - which looks dirty but ain’t really dirty (it’s salt rather than bacteria) 
So if you get bothered by that then RO unit won’t help.
8/6/21, 10:57 AM - Sumit: Depends if you are not worried about loosing your hair 😁
8/6/21, 11:00 AM - Vibhu: Thats true. A stop gap could be to use shower filter and use conditioner everyday (whenever you take shower to get rid of Mg and Ca residue from hair)
8/6/21, 11:01 AM - Vibhu: Salt in hair makes it hard (less moisture) changing texture and more prone to break
8/6/21, 11:42 AM - Ashu: I have nothing to worry about hair 😁
8/6/21, 11:43 AM - Ashu: All copper pipes already 
Softener 1200-1400
Plumbing 2500-3000 😥
8/6/21, 11:44 AM - Ashu: But yeah, can’t drink tap water yet, dishwasher leaves white residue everywhere even with rinse aid
8/6/21, 11:50 AM - Rashi: That’s how ours was too

8/25/21, 10:47 AM - Sumit: When are we all making a trip to Krispy creme to claim our free donuts 😁
8/25/21, 10:47 AM - Vibhu: I say Aug 30 😋
8/25/21, 10:49 AM - Sumit: Do I read it right - ‘every day’? That means 14 free donuts for this period?
8/25/21, 10:57 AM - Ashu: Technically you can go to different KK shop and get another round on the same day if you want ...
8/25/21, 10:57 AM - Ashu: Or the same shop after few hours (unless you have a very rememberable face!)
Think of the possibilities :P

9/7/21, 12:03 PM - Ashu: 👍
9/7/21, 12:03 PM - Ashu: When can we have malpua and gulab jamun with rum? 😋
9/7/21, 12:50 PM - Vibhu: I will be investing in Gelra’s startup snapmint in case if anybody is interested as they are raising. Till now I was putting NCDs in his company giving me 13-15% return per year.
9/7/21, 1:08 PM - Ashu: Since what year?
9/7/21, 1:21 PM - Vibhu: NCDs? It will be my 3rd year

9/7/21, 6:02 PM - Sumit: Hahaha.. that is practically a correct statement but key question is how much you are willing to pay for these incremental improvements😜
9/7/21, 6:07 PM - Vibhu: Looks like you have adopted Amazon leadership qualities quite well
9/7/21, 6:12 PM - Sumit: Have you noticed the pattern that iphone gen with odd numbers doesn’t have drastic improvements? Like iphone 12 much better than iphone 11.. no iphone 9 and filler model features in place of iphone 9.
9/7/21, 6:14 PM - Sumit: BTW, my willingness to pay for iphone 13 features is already very low so I decided to buy iphone 12 pro max with $250 out of pocket cost - looks like a better deal than getting a iphone 13.
9/7/21, 6:15 PM - Ashu: That’s a good deal!
9/7/21, 6:16 PM - Ashu: Tick tock equivalent 

iPhone se (2020) is basically IPhone 9 with no 9+ option

9/8/21, 10:18 PM - Sumit: Now I am thinking if I should have bought samsung Z fold 3 🤔
9/8/21, 10:20 PM - Ashu: You want a phone that works for 2 years or a phone that entertains you for 2 months? 😜
9/8/21, 10:22 PM - Sumit: Can’t choose between the two 😂
9/8/21, 10:24 PM - Ashu: Mustang vs Camry 
🤣
9/8/21, 10:27 PM - Sumit: If these were the choices - no question I’d pick mustang  😀
9/8/21, 11:00 PM - Rashi: Phone is utility and not entertainment.. for entertainment buy arcade 😂🤪
Sticking with iOS is key. Keeps things easier and smooth transition between devices. 
Fold phone would have definitely entertained but utility might have been compromised 😁
9/8/21, 11:07 PM - Sumit: Same applies for cars .. isn’t it? 😜
9/8/21, 11:10 PM - Sumit: Wondering why you didn’t buy camry 😛

9/11/21, 2:20 PM - Ashu: “It is, of course, almost hilariously convenient for a man who’s made millions slinging expensive lettuce to believe that the future of the republic might depend on the feds force-feeding people the food he already sells; that salad is the ideal medicine for an incredibly contagious respiratory virus might not be a trustworthy argument coming from a literal salad millionaire.”

9/27/21, 6:10 PM - Ashu: Anything that reduces the running? 😜
9/27/21, 6:14 PM - Padam Jain: I stopped reading at colorful.  Others are just for distraction

9/27/21, 7:30 PM - Ashu: Predictable yes
Less gross? 😱
9/27/21, 8:01 PM - Rashi: Blood bath is not the only gross.. watch old boy

9/28/21, 1:29 PM - Rashi: Haha what a joke
9/28/21, 1:29 PM - Rashi: But seriously that would be just awesome. We should make one and sell it to one of the big company and make billions
9/28/21, 1:30 PM - Rashi: This is actually my daily struggle these days. Which is necessity but I hate to do
9/28/21, 1:36 PM - Sumit: Amazon won’t make that …selling products is not their business model.

Like the flyers in mail that you ignore everyday
10/4/21, 6:23 PM - Padam Jain: You physically missed them or emotionally missed them 😃

10/25/21, 4:16 PM - Ashu: Wow! Did Vibhu cut all of this?
We have a new logger in town!!
10/25/21, 5:01 PM - Rashi: Yes he did and I arranged into piles. And ofcourse then I had to dance all over the leaves 😂
10/25/21, 5:02 PM - Rashi: If anyone wants wood for their fireplace today is the day to get it. Hopefully yard cleaner would take all of this tomorrow
10/25/21, 6:49 PM - Vibhu: <Media omitted>
10/25/21, 8:04 PM - Ashu: Where’s the dance video 🤣

10/26/21, 3:45 PM - Rashi: I did not know until now that there is Amazon pay which can be used for payments other than Amazon.com shopping
10/26/21, 4:17 PM - Ashu: It works just like PayPal payment 
And you get 5% on Amazon prime chase card
10/26/21, 4:20 PM - Sumit: Amazon pay is not available at retailers, mostly for online shopping but more popular among small sellers because of much small transactions fees.
10/26/21, 4:20 PM - Vibhu: And Wikipedia donation 😙
10/26/21, 4:20 PM - Ashu: And monoprice
10/26/21, 4:25 PM - Sumit: It’s not for rich people who can use apple pay. That’s why you haven’t heard of it 😂
10/26/21, 4:26 PM - Rashi: Haha I just used for Wikipedia donation.  Learning first time

10/29/21, 5:40 PM - Sumit: Zukelon kool-aid is on high demand 😂
10/29/21, 5:58 PM - Rashi: Happy hour?

10/31/21, 4:02 PM - Ashu: On my way in 5
10/31/21, 4:02 PM - Vibhu: What’s the plan
10/31/21, 4:02 PM - Vibhu: When are you guys (Sumit and Padam and kids) going for trick / treat
10/31/21, 4:06 PM - Padam Jain: Running late. Will leave in 10
10/31/21, 4:10 PM - Sumit: Aa jao… whenever you prepare the treat (ghewar) we will be ready for it😜

11/6/21, 1:06 PM - Ashu: Will bezos respond when I ask Alexa? 😜

11/6/21, 7:52 PM - Ashu: If it’s not signed by year end, I am planning to front load some after-tax-401k in January.

11/6/21, 7:54 PM - Ashu: Firstly, it would prohibit any after-tax contributions in 401(k) and other workplace plans and IRAs from being converted to Roth savings. This rule would apply to all income levels starting after Dec. 31, 2021.

11/10/21, 11:51 AM - Vibhu: Take a vacation

11/10/21, 11:52 AM - Padam Jain: Covered by insurance?
11/10/21, 11:56 AM - Ashu: 🤣
11/10/21, 11:57 AM - Ashu: Yep
Auto immune triggered by high stress
11/10/21, 11:59 AM - Leanne: Sorry ashu 😣 I also have autoimmune thyroid issue
11/10/21, 11:59 AM - Leanne: We are all getting older and more stressed 🙄
11/10/21, 12:22 PM - Ashu: Hashimoto's? They prescribe synthetic thyroid if I recall. My PCP in AZ put me on it, and within a week I was ridiculously hungry all the time! I stopped that and let things be.
11/10/21, 12:22 PM - Ashu: Yeah, we all need to start regular meditation 😇  (and/or happy hours😜)
11/10/21, 12:31 PM - Vibhu: Rivn 100+
11/10/21, 12:31 PM - Vibhu: All in for one meditation session a week
11/10/21, 6:09 PM - Leanne: Its like hashimotos, but postpartum. It actually was so bad right after Evi was born I went hyperthyroid for a while. Now we are waiting to see if I'll be permanently hypo 😬
11/10/21, 6:09 PM - Leanne: Everything I've read is that you should try the autoimmune disease, not the thyroid. Easier said than done
11/10/21, 7:14 PM - Ashu: Yikes! Hope it is balanced now.
11/10/21, 7:14 PM - Ashu: Reduce stress!
Avoid sugar and refined carbs

11/10/21, 8:01 PM - Ashu: Awesome 
Let me plan some logistics 

@15184950056  - do we need to reserve court?
11/10/21, 8:50 PM - Sumit: Can’t reserve the court but it is usually available since there is no net. I’ll bring the net and paddles. If we have two more paddles we can play doubles which is more fun.
11/10/21, 8:53 PM - Ashu: Sounds Good! 
@15182539537  - you have a second set, right?
11/10/21, 8:58 PM - Rashi: Nope
11/10/21, 9:11 PM - Ashu: @15182539537 n @15183204050 
Not here this weekend either?
When do you leave for mountains
11/10/21, 9:42 PM - Ashu: “Rivian’s debut in many ways defies typical market fundamentals: the startup is barely generating revenue and is still losing money. Wall Street is valuing it more than Ford Motor Co. and about on par with General Motors Co. , which are worth $77.4 billion and $86.05 billion, respectively.”

Not a single car sold from production and valuation higher/equals Ford and GM!! Wow
11/10/21, 10:36 PM - Sumit: Cathie Wood reportedly said Ark Invest won't buy Rivian stock due to the EV maker's 'rich' valuation
https://www.businessinsider.com/cathie-wood-ark-invest-wont-buy-rivian-stock-rich-valuation-2021-11
11/10/21, 10:42 PM - Sumit: Views from an another whatsapp group—> $RIVN is not an overpriced name as projected by business media … the stock IPOed at $78 and shot to $112 in no time … and then stabilised at 106.00 … but if you think of the EV segment and the coming of a solid operationalised incumbent with a path to profitability and an already existing customer base of regular and commercial buyers … this is a stock that might just double or quadruple in valuation in a short period of time … I can see how the first quarter might be rough as the earning will have to price the cost of going IPO and then the initial lockdown period ending will make existing investors cash out on their positions as this climbs … we should by no means discount it as a contender to $TSLA and with the backing of Bezos and his desire to rub one in on Elon he will at lengths to make that happen … if Elon’s tweets were a thing … watch out for Bezo’s tweets spiking $RIVN and tumbling $TSLA … this is Game on in the Billionaire Boy Club … and this will be a long one … and anyone’s guess who will be the last man standing …. 

But all said we can still wait a QE for it to bake well and baseline with some understanding of its exact financials before we engage on it.
11/10/21, 10:46 PM - Ashu: With Amazon owning 25% or so, Ford owning 5-10%, won’t be surprised if this becomes next Tesla 
Only if they can scale up and manage quality issues in production build. People were forgiving for Tesla but won’t be for anyone else now

11/10/21, 11:02 PM - Ashu: “When federal health authorities authorized COVID-19 vaccine boosters in September, they said the extra shots should be given to older adults or people at high risk. But Santa Clara County health officials took that a step further Wednesday, saying they will give any adult vaccinated six or more months ago another dose.”

11/12/21, 8:05 AM - Ashu: Oh yeah 
I forgot to put my maga hat on 😜
11/12/21, 8:07 AM - Ashu: Funny thing was that Levi’s stadium had the Covid vaccination at large scale and the huge billboards there had Microsoft ads running (bill gates was ‘accused’ of injecting chips via vaccine), and Intel inside ads 🤣
11/12/21, 9:51 AM - Sumit: Anyone feeling FOMO for RVIN boat ride? 😂

I will bring dessert
11/12/21, 1:59 PM - Ashu: Pls also check calendar invite
11/12/21, 1:59 PM - Sumit: I’ll bring badminton and tennis racquets also just in case there is interest in more activities.

Not one person asked to see covid related stuff in India!
They did ask to see negative report at sfo and stamped something on boarding pass in Delhi for all passengers from this flight as we deplaned. That was probably the check.

11/30/21, 1:59 PM - Padam Jain: Reminder to pay property tax to al the homeowners

12/1/21, 3:43 PM - Sumit: Gucci, on its part, has a collaboration with online gaming and game creation platform Roblox (RBLX) allowing players to purchase virtual products. There was so much hype to buy a virtual Gucci purse that it resold within the online marketplace for more money than its real-world counterpart, according to Morgan Stanley.

12/4/21, 4:53 PM - Vibhu: Time to diversify ?
12/4/21, 4:58 PM - Vibhu: Supposedly port waits are mostly over. Analysis I heard was that many companies moved from JIT to just in case and ordered 6 -8 months in advance, and left containers sitting dockside, as cheap storage (lime the story of the Gujju who parked his car at the bank). The new port czar has introduced a $100 per day fine, and already it has gone down considerably and will go back towards normalcy in a month. Rail has capacity, but there is a shortage of truck drivers 

The U.S. government's port envoy says container backlog is being cleared  - https://www.npr.org/2021/12/03/1061150220/the-u-s-governments-port-envoy-says-container-backlog-is-being-cleared

12/8/21, 1:06 PM - Vibhu: https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/kuo-apple-ar-vr-headset/
12/8/21, 1:12 PM - Sumit: What’s up with Apple and its $1000 price tag on everything? I’d rather buy oculus $300 headset but I’m also not an apple fanatic or early adopter anyway 😂

12/11/21, 1:59 AM - Ashu: Where’s mine???
12/11/21, 4:24 AM - Ashu: Apparently property taxes can be used for deductions (up to the limit) in the year they are paid, not when accrued. 
Since Santa Clara county splits required payment into Q4 and Q1, if Biden increases deductions limit beyond 10k, we can use 2022 Q1 payments towards it.

12/11/21, 11:32 AM - Padam Jain: This realtor sounds like the one who decides his clients and not the other way

12/24/21, 4:04 PM - Padam Jain: Thank you Ashu and Nila. It was very fun and relaxing.
12/24/21, 4:06 PM - Nila Le: Happy birthday again Padam! The pleasure is ours. I’m glad you and Sumit, Viraj, and Yuvi could come. We enjoyed your visit!!
12/24/21, 4:08 PM - Nila Le: Hope once you all feel better we could plan a day trip to SF or something. Sumit, Padam, and Ashu were discussing about it 😊.
12/24/21, 6:21 PM - Sumit: Thanks Ashu and Ni La for awesome Christmas party !! I just woke up from food and whiskey coma. Viraaj and Yuvi are still running around with sugar rush and so many gifts 😄
12/24/21, 6:25 PM - Sumit: How about 31st evening for new year celebration 🍾? Or we could do jan 1st evening to escape some crowd.
12/24/21, 6:38 PM - Sumit: The Al/ML needs to be put to better use to make people look slim so they can live in virtual reality world 😂

12/24/21, 8:34 PM - Padam Jain: 65" looks too big for your room
12/24/21, 8:41 PM - Vibhu: 😂 this is the best
12/24/21, 8:43 PM - Nila Le: Vibhu, I get the feeling you are now going to deny the fact you might have the same pair as they all do 😂😂😂
12/24/21, 8:43 PM - Vibhu: I am very happy that rashi is out of network for some time. Hopefully you will buy the tv by then
12/24/21, 8:44 PM - Ashu: 🤣
12/24/21, 8:45 PM - Ashu: Thinking of buying a Vizio again 
So I can buy newer cheaper in 6/7 years 
Unlike 2-3k Sony that just goes on and on
12/24/21, 8:46 PM - Vibhu: Is there any difference in picture quality  or brightness ratio ?
12/24/21, 8:46 PM - Padam Jain: Don't throw away if you loose one sock. One of us might have lost the same. Will make a new pair
12/24/21, 8:46 PM - Vibhu: I found vizio to be very bright but that could be just mental bias
12/24/21, 8:47 PM - Vibhu: I was thinking the same, that I should start buying socks from Costco. I have bad habit of losing one from pair. I can rely on you guys to complete the pair.
12/24/21, 8:48 PM - Nila Le: 🤣🤣🤣
12/24/21, 8:48 PM - Ashu: Now we have to save our socks from Vibhu

BJs or Cheesecake Factory?
12/27/21, 10:28 PM - Ashu: I can charge car there while we eat and drink. Then NiLa can drive me home. 😁
12/27/21, 10:28 PM - Ashu: Btw see “don’t look up” on Netflix
12/27/21, 10:31 PM - Sumit: Thusday works
12/27/21, 10:32 PM - Sumit: It should be named “don’t see”
12/27/21, 10:33 PM - Sumit: They tried to make SNL show movie but it wasn’t even funny !!
12/27/21, 10:36 PM - Ashu: lol 
Interesting thing is script was more or less finalized before Jan 2020
12/28/21, 11:42 AM - Ashu: Stocks in red today - looks like people selling to harvest tax loss
What is a good buy?
12/28/21, 12:21 PM - Sumit: Looks like a relatively flat day..
12/28/21, 12:22 PM - Sumit: Tesla announcing deliveries number on Jan 3 ..
12/28/21, 12:22 PM - Sumit: That will move tesla more
12/28/21, 12:24 PM - Sumit: Shalini’s cousin ordered a tesla 20 days back and was told delivery in July but it got pulled in and delivered yesterday… looks like tesla is ramping deliveries significantly even with supply chain challenges. That will come out big positive along with China delivery increase.
12/28/21, 1:30 PM - Ashu: oh wow! Was there a cancellation and slot given to cousin, or the whole backlog moved by 6 months??
12/28/21, 1:30 PM - Ashu: model Y I presume?
That's what they are prioritizing mfg right now
12/28/21, 1:31 PM - Sumit: Not sure about the reason for pull-in.
12/28/21, 1:31 PM - Sumit: Yes model-Y
12/28/21, 1:34 PM - Ashu: Colleague of mine got Y in 20 days in early Nov
Same story, originally wait of 6 months, but delivered in 3 weeks ...
12/28/21, 1:35 PM - Ashu: Interestingly, they just drop off the car in your driveway like an amazon pkg delivery. You log on to your Tesla account to unlock the car and set up etc..
12/28/21, 1:37 PM - Sumit: Could be year end push as well so ramp up the numbers.
12/28/21, 1:39 PM - Sumit: Build back better bill should boost tesla… I think this bill will pass in Jan (Manchin can’t chin against it forever).
12/28/21, 3:27 PM - Sumit: Some apple employees are quietly sitting on big bonuses !! 

Apple is reportedly surprising some employees with massive bonuses up to $180,000
https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-engineer-bonuses-employees-meta-facebook-talent-2021-12
12/28/21, 3:30 PM - Padam Jain: Nice retention bonus.
12/28/21, 5:40 PM - Ashu: oh wow
12/29/21, 12:30 PM - Padam Jain: How about today?
12/29/21, 12:31 PM - Sumit: 👍

12/29/21, 12:51 PM - Sumit: Where? BJs?
12/29/21, 12:51 PM - Ashu: 👍

12/29/21, 3:02 PM - Nila Le: Are LeAnne and Shalini joining?
12/29/21, 3:08 PM - Padam Jain: Not Leanne. Her mom is here
12/29/21, 3:15 PM - Shalini Antil: Hi Nila ... yes i will come
12/29/21, 3:23 PM - Nila Le: 👍

12/29/21, 5:43 PM - Padam Jain: Is there a reservation?
12/29/21, 5:50 PM - Padam Jain: Got a table for us in far back

12/29/21, 8:25 PM - Ashu: Where are you guys playing tomorrow morning?
I might need some help to go pick tv 😜
12/29/21, 8:27 PM - Padam Jain: Where do you need to pick tv from?
12/29/21, 8:27 PM - Ashu: Costco 😎🤣
12/29/21, 8:27 PM - Ashu: Going with Sony this time

Nah just Standard

1/1/22, 9:45 AM - Ashu: Afternoon coffee in SF?
1/1/22, 9:45 AM - Padam Jain: Leanne had her booster shot yesterday. Not doing well. Will need to stay home
1/1/22, 10:20 AM - Sumit: What time are you thinking about?
1/1/22, 10:22 AM - Nila Le: What do you think of 12 or 12:30?
1/1/22, 10:23 AM - Nila Le: Happy New Year! Hope you all get enough rest. I won’t have my booster shot until Tues 😊
1/1/22, 11:26 AM - Ashu: Oh take rest

1/2/22, 8:03 AM - Vibhu: 5th
1/2/22, 8:24 AM - Sumit: 'No worries,' 'you're on mute' and 'circle back' should be banished, annual list says
https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/02/us/banished-words-2021-cec/index.html
1/2/22, 1:30 PM - Rashi: Don’t worry I won’t buy this. If I buy it will be oled tv. I am hoping prices might go down after ces. What do you all think
1/2/22, 1:30 PM - Rashi: And please find me a deal for 65-70 inch tv :)
1/2/22, 1:30 PM - Rashi: Vibhu agreed I can buy 😂
1/2/22, 8:40 PM - Ashu: So chhole bhature on 6th or 7th? 🤣
1/2/22, 8:50 PM - Vibhu: Considering omicron surge, wouldn’t be a bad idea for me to quarantine for a day or two and get the test result before anybody of you see ghewar
1/2/22, 8:51 PM - Padam Jain: You can put the ghevar and mithai boxes out of the door and quarantine.  There is no correlation between the two events
1/2/22, 8:52 PM - Vibhu: I will be doing that every Monday evening 😛
1/2/22, 8:53 PM - Padam Jain: 🤣
1/3/22, 9:16 AM - Sumit: <Media omitted>
1/3/22, 11:12 AM - Ashu: Didn’t 😭
1/3/22, 11:12 AM - Ashu: It jumped 11% today!!!
1/3/22, 11:13 AM - Ashu: AAPL $3Trillion market cap!!
1/3/22, 11:40 AM - Sumit: It still a good stock to buy… this year it should cross 200 for sure.
1/3/22, 11:41 AM - Sumit: May be in next couple of months 😄
1/3/22, 1:30 PM - Sumit: Lets see if tesla can hold above the key fibonacci level of $1152 !!
1/3/22, 1:30 PM - Sumit: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-bounce-surpasses-key-fibonacci-retracement-level-11640630817
1/3/22, 5:36 PM - Ashu: Fibonacci? 
This is what happens when Wall Street hires math PhDs for long time
1/4/22, 11:30 AM - Ashu: dropped 4-5% today
1/4/22, 11:36 AM - Sumit: Nasdaq is killing it !! Divergence in market indexes is not a good sign for stock market (has been happening more often since last month).
1/4/22, 5:08 PM - Ashu: Half my teammates/families are testing covid positive 
All WFH
1/4/22, 5:10 PM - Padam Jain: LeAnne's hospital staff is coming down too. Couple of folks pinged me that they  have covid.
1/4/22, 5:12 PM - Sumit: Same here.. learning more often these days from people I know that they have covid !! Didn’t hear that before. Looks like omicron is really contagious !!
1/4/22, 5:46 PM - Rashi: We all will get it .. seems like. It’s really bad
1/4/22, 5:46 PM - Rashi: I have test scheduled for next week.
1/4/22, 5:46 PM - Leanne: Padam and I were just saying this
1/4/22, 5:46 PM - Rashi: Test appointment also are tough to get now
1/4/22, 5:47 PM - Rashi: But whichever cases I have heard the symptoms are very mild
1/4/22, 6:06 PM - Ashu: Yeah 
Mild symptoms is the silver lining
1/4/22, 6:20 PM - Vibhu: 9 times more infectious. Can spread with mask also.
1/4/22, 6:40 PM - Rashi: Rapid test doesn’t work for omicron. So if anyone is exposed or feel any symptoms get PCR.
1/4/22, 6:57 PM - Sumit: How to differentiate if it is omicron mild symptom or regular cold symptom?
1/4/22, 6:58 PM - Sumit: I think Shalini and I both felt after SF trip that we caught something. At home test didn’t show anything. Both of us feeling ok now. Not sure what it was.
1/4/22, 6:59 PM - Rashi: You should get tested
1/4/22, 6:59 PM - Rashi: Kaiser has online evisit question form. Answer that and they will let you schedule one
1/4/22, 7:00 PM - Rashi: I have appointment for Jan 12
1/4/22, 7:00 PM - Rashi: It says if you are vaccinated and exposed then get tested 5-7 days after exposure
1/4/22, 7:00 PM - Rashi: Symptoms are like regular flu
1/4/22, 7:01 PM - Sumit: Looks like you will get tested before us so we will find out what it was 😬
1/4/22, 7:02 PM - Sumit: How is Ashu and Ni La doing?
1/4/22, 7:02 PM - Rashi: 👍
1/4/22, 7:02 PM - Sumit: Are you feeling something as well?
1/4/22, 7:03 PM - Rashi: I think I am exposed that’s why I am getting tested
1/4/22, 7:03 PM - Nila Le: 🤞🤞🤞
1/4/22, 7:03 PM - Sumit: If Ashu and Ni La are ok then I think we got it from you 😡
1/4/22, 7:04 PM - Nila Le: Hope you and Shalini feel better. But do go get it tested…
1/4/22, 7:04 PM - Nila Le: 😂😂😂
1/4/22, 7:04 PM - Rashi: I met you guys before I was exposed 🥺
1/4/22, 7:05 PM - Nila Le: Ashu saw your texts, Sumit. And now he is so worried that he bundled up under blankets.
1/4/22, 7:05 PM - Nila Le: 😂
1/4/22, 7:06 PM - Nila Le: But yeah, we feel OK so far
1/4/22, 7:07 PM - Nila Le: We do rapid tests almost weekly. The last one was just right before our SF trip.
1/4/22, 7:10 PM - Rashi: Rapid test doesn’t show positive for omicron
1/4/22, 7:16 PM - Nila Le: 🥲
1/4/22, 7:37 PM - Sumit: We also came back negative with rapid test .. symptomatic test scheduled at kaiser on jan 14.
1/4/22, 7:39 PM - Sumit: that’s 10 days from now !!! 😥 anyway even if we get it, don’t think there is anything that we can do other than praying for it to go away 😂
1/4/22, 7:42 PM - Vibhu: Antibody test will be more useful probably
1/4/22, 7:53 PM - Rashi: On a brighter side .. cdc guideline doesn’t need us to quarantine if vaccinated. However this doesn’t mean we don’t keep the distance.
1/4/22, 7:53 PM - Sumit: Recommended only after 3-4 weeks of infection
1/4/22, 7:53 PM - Rashi: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html
1/4/22, 7:54 PM - Rashi: Vaccinated and show no symptoms
1/4/22, 7:54 PM - Sumit: Yeah yoi don’t need to quarantine but Vibhu needs to find a hotel when he comes back 😂
1/4/22, 7:54 PM - Rashi: He will be more contagious than me
1/4/22, 7:55 PM - Vibhu: PCR negative till yesterday, no symptoms till now and keeping 12 feet distance from everybody with double masked
1/4/22, 7:55 PM - Vibhu: But who knows
1/4/22, 7:55 PM - Rashi: Wow
1/4/22, 8:10 PM - Padam Jain: Very impressive to keep 12ft distance in India
1/4/22, 8:11 PM - Padam Jain: In summary, we are not seeing each other for a while
1/4/22, 8:22 PM - Sumit: and I am eating more bakhlawa and halwa today in stress 😬
1/4/22, 8:24 PM - Sumit: Too bad you can’t even self invite yourself 😜
1/4/22, 8:27 PM - Padam Jain: Sumit, this is a great time for you to make Malpuas
1/4/22, 8:36 PM - Sumit: 😂
1/4/22, 8:40 PM - Vibhu: Yes, he can always leave them outside door .. like food is left outside for cows in India
1/4/22, 8:41 PM - Sumit: <Media omitted>
1/4/22, 8:43 PM - Sumit: Did Anaya go today?
1/4/22, 8:44 PM - Sumit: We didn’t send viraaj and yuvi as we feared this will happen after holiday.
1/4/22, 8:47 PM - Padam Jain: Yes. She was there today. Need to make appointment for her
1/4/22, 8:56 PM - Rashi: <Media omitted>
1/4/22, 8:58 PM - Rashi: Sumit tum bas banao. Maein aajao hi collect karne aur khane 😈
1/4/22, 9:01 PM - Rashi: कुत्ते को सैर करवाते हुए कोई मिलता था तो हम कहते थे, घबराओ नहीं, इसको सारे इंजेक्शन लगे हैं।

बस अब यही हाल हमारा है...  😅
1/4/22, 9:02 PM - Ashu: Wait till you get to any airport in India
12 feet —> 12 cm
1/4/22, 9:02 PM - Vibhu: It wasn’t that bad ..
1/4/22, 9:03 PM - Vibhu: Boarded now from doha to CA
1/4/22, 9:03 PM - Ashu: Exactly 
What’s the pick up time?
Let’s have it before Vibhu returns
1/4/22, 9:03 PM - Ashu: 👍
1/4/22, 9:04 PM - Rashi: Sumit lag jao bas. Night out tumhara
1/4/22, 9:04 PM - Ashu: Colleague mentioned Kyla app to get test appointments
1/4/22, 9:05 PM - Sumit: 🤦🏻

1/4/22, 9:06 PM - Ashu: Wasn’t this supposed to get herd immunity?
1/4/22, 9:06 PM - Rashi: Huh! I was thinking omicron will happen to all do immunity increase and then all will be fine
1/4/22, 9:06 PM - Padam Jain: Can it find any test appointments
1/4/22, 9:06 PM - Padam Jain: Can not
1/4/22, 9:07 PM - Rashi: Try fulgent
1/4/22, 9:07 PM - Rashi: Or Covid clinic
1/4/22, 9:07 PM - Rashi: They have
1/4/22, 9:07 PM - Padam Jain: We already should have gotten that after two shots of vaccine
1/4/22, 9:08 PM - Padam Jain: Fulgent doesn't have
1/4/22, 9:08 PM - Rashi: Covid clinic click in zero dollar one
1/4/22, 9:08 PM - Rashi: They have on and off. Keep refreshing
1/4/22, 9:08 PM - Rashi: I saw this morning
1/4/22, 9:08 PM - Sumit: The more it spreads, the more breading ground virus has.
1/4/22, 9:08 PM - Rashi: But all for Jan 12 or later
1/4/22, 9:09 PM - Padam Jain: Yep
1/4/22, 9:09 PM - Sumit: It will keep evolving every year like H1N1 and we get yearly flu shot
1/4/22, 9:09 PM - Padam Jain: Covid clinic is after 15
1/4/22, 9:11 PM - Rashi: Yea I got for vibhu fir 13t in morning so now I can imagine
1/4/22, 9:11 PM - Rashi: Just get it and keep
1/4/22, 9:11 PM - Rashi: It is anyways recommended 5-7 days after exposure

1/8/22, 1:55 PM - Ashu: Doesn’t say ‘don’t be evil’
Just that you don’t to be evil to make money

1/8/22, 2:19 PM - Sumit: 😂
1/8/22, 2:26 PM - Sumit: Conclusion: nobody lives by principles or at best they are selective about it when needed !!! 😜 End of discussion 😂
1/8/22, 2:27 PM - Padam Jain: Can we at least get beer out of that $50 card as a consolation prize for persuasion?
1/8/22, 2:28 PM - Sumit: Too late.. conclusion already made that includes me!!
1/8/22, 2:28 PM - Sumit: You will have to give up on prime membership to win that prize 😜🤣

They will ask if you have an appointment don’t say no but say you have order number and they will do the test. I just did mine. Results to be out hopefully in two days. And then I also have another test on wed.

1/15/22, 10:59 AM - Padam Jain: Viraj might like their rope nwt
1/15/22, 10:59 AM - Sumit: If you leave at 3pm then will get only 1.5 hrs of sunlight. I’ll probably reach there early.

I have a feeling I got it, and I am past spreading. My 1/12 test came negative but my 1/10 results hasn’t come yet
1/15/22, 12:40 PM - Sumit: @14803597410 @15172039677 what are you guys up to? Do you want to join us?

1/15/22, 5:33 PM - Rashi: Rapid we get free anyways from work. And omicron isn’t detected by it unfortunately
1/15/22, 5:33 PM - Ashu: Can they differentiate between antibodies from vaccine vs infection?
1/15/22, 5:33 PM - Rashi: Ah don’t know
1/15/22, 5:33 PM - Ashu: The Cue test we got detects it. 
My colleagues are evidence 😜

1/17/22, 7:59 AM - Padam Jain: 🤣
1/17/22, 8:02 AM - Vibhu: I am sure sumit and Padam are well trained to take care of this baby
1/17/22, 8:07 AM - Nila Le: Padam and Sumit are overqualified 😂. This baby just needs to fed by liquors and sweets 🤣. So you can take care of him too, Vibhu😀.
1/17/22, 8:08 AM - Nila Le: to be fed*

Didn’t feel like eating salad on Fri evening so basically leftover
1/17/22, 4:30 PM - Padam Jain: No home delivery although people did ask for it at the beginning of pandemic
1/17/22, 4:42 PM - Sumit: Google has new mandate for employees in the US

1/17/22, 4:44 PM - Sumit: How do you provide proof of negative at-home-test? Looks like our daycare is also mandating every kid to have at-home negative test every Monday as entry requirement for the week.
1/17/22, 4:47 PM - Sumit: Noe there will be stock piling of these tests - yet another supply chain issue. Kaiser has automated message that they are not keeping any stock of these test kits !!
1/17/22, 4:51 PM - Nila Le: Spoilers!!
1/17/22, 4:52 PM - Nila Le: 😟
1/17/22, 4:53 PM - Nila Le: I think Googlers have the cue kit
1/17/22, 4:53 PM - Ashu: Just another way for corporations to make money off of government. The new government site will be ready to order January 20

Lab Test results for five days by then the CDC recommended quarantine is over anyway
1/17/22, 7:57 PM - Rashi: We get from work. Check with your company they might have something too. Most companies are providing to employees as they require some of them to come to work. 
We have same policy to get negative test before coming on site

1/18/22, 1:04 PM - Leanne: And Anaya+/-evi
1/18/22, 3:41 PM - Ashu: Effective January 20, 2022, we expect everyone (including vaccinated employees) to obtain a negative COVID-19 molecular test (e.g. PCR, Cue) no more than seven days prior to working onsite in the U.S. (or each day you come on site if using an antigen test). 

We need negative test proof to go to office now.

1/18/22, 9:41 PM - Ashu: 👍

1/21/22, 12:09 PM - Padam Jain: ?
1/21/22, 12:09 PM - Sumit: Stock number
1/21/22, 12:45 PM - Rashi: If stock numbers then doesn’t matter right. If $$ then #stock will be higher today. Or am I getting it wrong
1/21/22, 1:03 PM - Sumit: If you have a finalized comp level (usually negotiated in dollars) then if stock value is low, you get more stocks..
1/21/22, 1:07 PM - Rashi: Ok correct then it is $$ based
1/21/22, 1:08 PM - Sumit: Offer letter has number of stocks.. not $ value!
1/21/22, 1:13 PM - Rashi: Sorry then how lower stock price helps if stock number is fixed. May be in person education

There are no I-50 and I-60, as routes with those numbers would likely pass through states that currently have U.S. Highways with the same numbers, which is generally disallowed under highway administration guidelines

2/17/22, 7:15 PM - Sumit: Acquisition is relatively easy, integration is not… let see how Intel does it differently this time.
2/17/22, 7:16 PM - Ashu: Even if they just let it run as wholly owned subsidiary like alterra they will do okay 
Bunch of defense contracts
2/17/22, 7:16 PM - Padam Jain: Altera is not doing ok.

2/22/22, 8:55 AM - Vibhu: <Media omitted>
2/22/22, 12:33 PM - Vibhu: Looks like a good buy opportunity in market if there is by cash standing
2/22/22, 12:33 PM - Padam Jain: Buy what?
2/22/22, 12:35 PM - Sumit: Why do you think it will be better tomorrow?
2/22/22, 12:35 PM - Vibhu: Weren’t you all saying market is going down 😁
2/22/22, 12:35 PM - Vibhu: Paypal
2/22/22, 12:36 PM - Vibhu: Indices
2/22/22, 12:37 PM - Vibhu: More nvda for Sumit
2/22/22, 12:38 PM - Sumit: <Media omitted>
2/22/22, 12:39 PM - Vibhu: Are you still holding roku?
2/22/22, 12:40 PM - Vibhu: SQ, RBLX, docu and clov sounds good in the list
2/22/22, 12:43 PM - Sumit: Looks like pandemic ride is over for roku.. it’s gonna be tough be from here on with crowded space and strong competitors.
2/22/22, 12:49 PM - Sumit: Joining this list FB has 40% market cap wiped off now in last two months !!
2/22/22, 12:49 PM - Vibhu: I will go bullish on FB with this price
2/22/22, 12:50 PM - Vibhu: P/E of 14
2/22/22, 12:52 PM - Padam Jain: How much are you putting in FB?
2/22/22, 12:53 PM - Vibhu: I think there is an opportunity to buy here (and buy more if Ukraine escalates) 
- people who have cashed out in Dec would like to come back 
- correction, inflation, fed, Ukraine, etc is already accounted in. It can go only up
- if there is further dip on Ukraine, it will recover fast. So but more when dips more than 8%
2/22/22, 12:53 PM - Padam Jain: Agree.
2/22/22, 12:53 PM - Padam Jain: ??
2/22/22, 12:54 PM - Sumit: Yeah better bet for next 4 year if you are thinking about Intel vs. FB (close enough PE)😁
2/22/22, 12:54 PM - Vibhu: I have put bet on both (long). Intel when CEO changed and FB early Feb when  it dropped
2/22/22, 12:55 PM - Sumit: Btw Intel is delaying first EUV server chip launch to 2024 now !!
2/22/22, 12:57 PM - Vibhu: https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-manufacturers/intel/308311-intel-2022-investor-meeting/
2/22/22, 12:58 PM - Vibhu: <Media omitted>
2/22/22, 12:59 PM - Vibhu: With fleet of 30 euv machines (3x00), which is investment of 5B$, the capacity won’t sit idle
2/22/22, 1:00 PM - Sumit: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/18/intel-delays-granite-rapids-says-it-needs-to-boost-spending.html
2/22/22, 1:00 PM - Vibhu: They are putting further orders. Would it be used for server is a different question. 
Does that money have to made in server only is another.
2/22/22, 1:03 PM - Sumit: I liked powerpoints 😁 but not anymore 😝
2/22/22, 1:05 PM - Vibhu: Oh that wasn’t for the roadmap, but more on how much capacity they have currently and when they will start to get 0.55 NA EUV.
2/22/22, 1:06 PM - Vibhu: Intel has legacy design restrictions which 0.33 NA EUV can not resolve. So three options:
- use EUV current capacity for something else (they are doing it ) 
- change design rules (difficult but they are working on it)
- early adopter for 0.55 NA EUV which will solve the problem
2/22/22, 1:09 PM - Sumit: That’s the reason investor community is not happy as product roadmap shifting again and all these heavy investments are going to affect balance sheet… so it would be tough for Intel stock to see any growth in next 3-4 years regardless of how fancy is their EUV spending roadmap is.
2/22/22, 1:12 PM - Sumit: It might be good to buy ASML.
2/22/22, 1:17 PM - Sumit: AMD is probably much better bet than Intel at this time.
2/22/22, 10:19 PM - Ashu: <Media omitted>
2/22/22, 10:19 PM - Ashu: 18% hike in electric and gas
2/22/22, 10:44 PM - Ashu: “The technology was designed to imitate the feel of a manual gearbox, but it won’t bring any performance benefit to the vehicle”

Why!!! 😳

2/23/22, 8:17 AM - Ashu: What else are you buying today?
2/23/22, 8:33 AM - Sumit: Rivian is a good entry point at 58. Earning in two weeks.
2/23/22, 9:44 AM - Vibhu: I was thinking donuts 🍩
2/23/22, 9:45 AM - Sumit: You probably think about donuts everyday 😜
2/23/22, 9:48 AM - Sumit: Some of us can’t “afford” to buy donuts everyday 😂

2/23/22, 12:14 PM - Sumit: Now if China invades Taiwan market will officially be moving from correction to recession !!
2/23/22, 1:18 PM - Ashu: between correction and recession, there will be ww3 mode if China invades Taiwan
2/23/22, 2:34 PM - Vibhu: https://youtu.be/cu32J3ADibo
2/23/22, 6:13 PM - Ashu: So 85 was a good entry point for Rashi 
58 for me
What’s *your* good entry point? 🤣
2/23/22, 6:14 PM - Sumit: 85-58 😂
2/23/22, 6:18 PM - Padam Jain: Did Rashi enter at 85?
2/23/22, 6:19 PM - Padam Jain: It might be good time for her to avarage down 😃
2/23/22, 6:22 PM - Ashu: How many did you buy?
2/23/22, 6:22 PM - Nila Le: Ashu thinks it’s good too. But I learned to wait every time he says it’s good to buy 😂😂😂
2/23/22, 6:24 PM - Nila Le: Good choice 🤣
2/23/22, 7:15 PM - Ashu: Russia's Putin announces military operation in Ukraine

2/23/22, 7:16 PM - Vibhu: Yeah now simit will buy rivian
2/23/22, 7:27 PM - Sumit: Missiles coming to wall street tomorrow 🥶😤 not sure how to duck and cover 🤷‍♂️
2/23/22, 7:29 PM - Vibhu: Use cash as your shield …. Buy more
2/23/22, 7:32 PM - Sumit: Market is red everyday, everyweek now!!! Kuber ka khajana thodi na mere pass ki cash nikalta hi rahega 😡
2/23/22, 7:44 PM - Rashi: 😂

2/24/22, 11:45 AM - Rashi: Are we drinking today to celebrate market slightly recovering? 😂
2/24/22, 11:47 AM - Sumit: It will be red tomorrow !!
2/24/22, 11:49 AM - Rashi: Exactly. Celebrate before we frustrate again
2/24/22, 12:23 PM - Ashu: What is wrong with market?
Until yesterday there was expectation of war it might or might not happen and the market was dropping
Now that put in actually started the war, market is going up!!
2/24/22, 12:24 PM - Ashu: Basically the ambiguity penalty is gone today; but rest remains
2/24/22, 12:28 PM - Sumit: I can never deal with mood swings 😂
2/24/22, 12:34 PM - Sumit: I think Biden’s comment made a difference - US won’t send its army in Ukraine but deal indirectly through sanction.
2/24/22, 12:35 PM - Sumit: This war could be a good think for tech stocks as DOW industrial will see the most impact because of sanctions so investors may move money in nasdaq/tech heavy stocks.
2/24/22, 12:37 PM - Sumit: But the war would also add to inflation on few things but that is probably trending less of a concern on US economy and interest rate plans already baked in.
2/24/22, 12:42 PM - Sumit: Not sure about impact of these electronic sanction on semi industry !!

2/24/22, 1:25 PM - Padam Jain: War is always good for economy
2/24/22, 2:57 PM - Vibhu: So did anybody follow SQ today ? 😍
2/24/22, 3:13 PM - Sumit: It’s hard to predict which direction investors’ sentiments will go… SQ dropped after earning release but jumped up after earning call 🤷‍♂️ … the earning numbers stayed the same… it could have gone other way too.
2/24/22, 3:15 PM - Ashu: I am quite -ve on Shopify 😩
2/24/22, 3:15 PM - Sumit: ARK made good money on SQ as it has been buying a lot of this stock recently
2/24/22, 3:19 PM - Rashi: Don’t talk about negative. I am almost 30-45% down in my portfolio 😬
2/24/22, 3:20 PM - Rashi: Looks like people do need a drink after all

2/24/22, 11:03 PM - Vibhu: I do feel that China - Taiwan thing can escalate in near future unless some solution comes for EUV in China. This will give a pretty big drop to tech sector. It is not an unlikely scenario anymore. 
Huawei dumping money left and right on EUV infrastructure  even though they can’t get scanner
2/25/22, 8:21 AM - Sumit: <Media omitted>
2/25/22, 8:46 AM - Ashu: Difference is she bought at low; I am still holding from high
2/25/22, 8:46 AM - Ashu: No appetite to double down

2/25/22, 11:33 AM - Rashi: Why is sq not here. That’s 23%
2/25/22, 11:37 AM - Sumit: Sq is not listed in Dow.. even big companies like Amazon are not listed in Dow. Most tech companies will be included in nasdaq or nyse.
2/25/22, 11:38 AM - Rashi: Sumit galat field mein bethe hue ho. Investment banking mei hona chahiye tha tumko
2/25/22, 11:39 AM - Sumit: 😂😂
2/25/22, 11:40 AM - Rashi: Abhi bhi time hai
2/25/22, 11:41 AM - Rashi: Ny is calling you
2/25/22, 11:41 AM - Rashi: Apna portfolio fir tumko pakda doongi and you can have 5% cut. 😂🤓
2/25/22, 11:42 AM - Vibhu: 5% 😱
2/25/22, 11:59 AM - Ashu: my proposal beat S&P average by 5% for me, anything on top of that “sp500+5%” is yours
2/25/22, 12:00 PM - Ashu: And if it is less than that, you can reimburse me 🤣
2/25/22, 12:02 PM - Vibhu: I am also willing to put my money in that fund
2/25/22, 12:02 PM - Sumit: Looks like you guys have very high expectations from me 😂
2/25/22, 12:06 PM - Rashi: Ofcourse! And I believe in making good jlebis as bribe 😈

2/25/22, 5:32 PM - Sumit: Ashu’s question above was confusing - Look at the concluding paragraph at the bottom, not the whole kahani 😜
2/25/22, 5:32 PM - Ashu: Does anyone here have their gmail connected to phone mail/calendar?
If not, highly recommended
2/25/22, 5:34 PM - Ashu: That was a test 
How accurately do you glean critical info from complex discussions
You failed, gotta increase baseline to sp500+6% now
2/25/22, 5:35 PM - Ashu: I just realized I might be the only one here with zero mails in gmail inbox
2/25/22, 5:37 PM - Vibhu: Yes .. what’s so great about it ?
2/25/22, 5:37 PM - Ashu: All incoming calendar invites are auto added to phone calendar
2/25/22, 5:37 PM - Ashu: And it will tell you when to leave for destination as well
2/25/22, 5:37 PM - Vibhu: No it doesn’t
2/25/22, 5:38 PM - Vibhu: Yes
2/25/22, 5:38 PM - Ashu: I need to look again in my settings then
Mine does

2/26/22, 10:19 AM - Ashu: To Amazon.com and shopping.google.com
2/26/22, 10:19 AM - Padam Jain: It might not be girly enough otherwise
2/26/22, 10:19 AM - Rashi: Naaa we need real store s

2/26/22, 12:32 PM - Vibhu: How about a competition.
Everybody wears one most outrageously glittering metro fashionable thing. It could be a dress or shoe or brocade or skarf or socks or anything. People do popular vote their #1, #2 and #3 choices on thing (not person but only one thing per person). With a complicated algorithm winner will be decided. 

Sumit will take Winner for shopping and will buy his choice.
2/26/22, 12:33 PM - Sumit: Jhakkas !!
2/26/22, 12:36 PM - Sumit: What do I get in return 😜

3/4/22, 6:15 PM - Ashu: Isn’t it supposed to go back up now??
3/4/22, 6:23 PM - Sumit: Yeah … but that means stock returns will be quite low for this ratio to come up. Commodity returns will be high due to inflation so investment landscape will be different for this year.
3/4/22, 6:24 PM - Ashu: I put some money in commodities index last year, still going down 😭
3/4/22, 6:25 PM - Sumit: Ukraine-Russia war is just going to further pressure on stock market and increase inflation
3/4/22, 6:25 PM - Sumit: Which ones?
3/4/22, 6:28 PM - Ashu: Vanguard
3/4/22, 6:28 PM - Sumit: I should have put some in UGO, USO crude oil .. it just sky rocketed in last few days

3/4/22, 6:30 PM - Ashu: <Media omitted>
3/4/22, 6:34 PM - Ashu: Yeah 
War and oil go together 
Though don’t buy USO, they sell ‘partnerships’ not shares so you have to file Form K or something with taxes
3/4/22, 11:24 PM - Ashu: For more entertainment, first watch the movie awakenings, then OA. Of course with a bit of suspension of belief.

- nothing about AR/VR

3/7/22, 11:46 AM - Ashu: The best iDevices ever

3/8/22, 10:26 AM - Vibhu: Same goes with remarkable, amazing, impact . May be everybody takes a word and take a sip when the word comes in
3/8/22, 10:28 AM - Vibhu: Rashi, can we get the transcript of their past keynotes. I really want to do linguistic analysis and find the most used words.
3/8/22, 10:30 AM - Sumit: It might be too early to say.. i think market will flip or erase this spike by the end of the day.
3/8/22, 10:38 AM - Rashi: “Ever” 😭😂
3/8/22, 10:39 AM - Rashi: Let’s do it. Drinking Tuesday !!

3/8/22, 6:12 PM - Leanne: Aw yes that's definitely true ashu. I'm sure you still have a ways to go yet
3/8/22, 6:44 PM - Ashu: What a night and day difference with epidural!!
Not sure how she had been managing since 1am-5pm
3/8/22, 6:45 PM - Leanne: Thank goodness and yes epidural are so amazing

3/9/22, 11:42 AM - Leanne: I think I got it 😅 we will see whenever you say it for the first time 😂
3/9/22, 11:43 AM - Vibhu: I thought swaddle is a new variant game of Wordle like needle, shabdle, quordle, Octordle and jumped on Google in try this new game. 

Googling made me realize that I am better off not playing this game.
3/9/22, 11:43 AM - Ashu: 😂
Success criteria is baby doesn’t free up hands in next 10 minutes
3/9/22, 11:49 AM - Leanne: Haha good luck with that 😂
3/9/22, 11:50 AM - Vibhu: Duct tape doesn’t work 😈

3/9/22, 7:28 PM - Vibhu: Remember you are on keto and I am a call away to help you in anyway
3/9/22, 7:35 PM - Padam Jain: It is just the beginning for Ashu. It will all start accumulating now
3/9/22, 7:41 PM - Ashu: Accumulation phase started long ago 🤣😜
3/9/22, 7:45 PM - Leanne: Cute!! Birthday cake😅
3/9/22, 7:52 PM - Padam Jain: Ashu, great incentive to go again there 😜
3/10/22, 10:03 AM - Padam Jain: How was your first night with the Anika?
3/10/22, 10:37 AM - Ashu: We are both bit in zombies mode already
3/10/22, 10:38 AM - Ashu: White noise with womb sounds is magical
3/10/22, 10:38 AM - Leanne: We will let you know when zombie mode improves... So far nothing...
3/10/22, 10:39 AM - Ashu: 😬😱
3/10/22, 10:40 AM - Leanne: 😅no seriously totally understand, that first night is something to experience, so hard and exhausting and beautiful too. Hope today brings a little rest
3/10/22, 10:42 AM - Leanne: I remember second day being  tough too with a billion visits from nurses, testing, Drs, certificate ppl, lactation etc
3/10/22, 10:44 AM - Ashu: Yeah it’s non stop!
3/10/22, 10:46 AM - Ashu: Got birth certificate paperwork done
Now can manage to swaddle without hands coming out in 10 minutes 
And can go from deep sleep to on my feet in seconds, without coffee 🤣
3/10/22, 10:46 AM - Leanne: So much progress in so little time 😅
3/10/22, 11:14 AM - Rashi: We can feel your excitement :) super awesome!
3/11/22, 2:16 PM - Rashi: Rivian 38 🥺
3/11/22, 2:32 PM - Ashu: Who’s buying now? Sumit? Or Padam?
3/11/22, 2:42 PM - Vibhu: Looks like you excluded me 😡
3/11/22, 2:43 PM - Vibhu: 33B market cap at this price looks attractive
3/11/22, 2:44 PM - Vibhu: I think it’s a buy now
3/11/22, 2:50 PM - Ashu: <Media omitted>
3/11/22, 4:29 PM - Ashu: You will be the last to buy rivn I am sure
3/11/22, 4:49 PM - Rashi: My neighbor works at rivian but owns Tesla 🤦‍♀️
3/11/22, 5:04 PM - Leanne: Not bad and great pic!!
3/11/22, 5:28 PM - Vibhu: 😍
3/11/22, 6:13 PM - Ashu: 🤣
3/11/22, 11:31 PM - Vibhu: M1 Ultra is essentially two M1 Max chips connected with Apple's new Ultra Fusion die-to-die interconnect, which delivers 2.5TB/s of inter-processor bandwidth (more than 4x the bandwidth of the leading multi-chip interconnect technology, and 2x the connection density).
3/11/22, 11:32 PM - Vibhu: M1 Ultra’s GPU, which is said to be capable of delivering similar performance to an unnamed yet allegedly “popular” discrete PC GPU while using 1/3 of the power
3/11/22, 11:33 PM - Vibhu: twice the connection density of anything comparable in the industry today by connecting over 10,000 signals with a mind-blowing 2.5TB/s of interprocessor bandwidth between the chips
3/12/22, 5:33 AM - Ashu: Yeah that D2D implementation is the big news in all of this
3/12/22, 5:34 AM - Ashu: Guess apple got tired of wafer to wafer get production ready

3/12/22, 8:50 AM - Padam Jain: Anyone up for biking today?
3/12/22, 9:26 AM - Padam Jain: This message was deleted
3/12/22, 1:02 PM - Ashu: Yes!! Still struggling to setup some process! I was planning to finish all preps this weekend and she decided to come early 😜🤣
3/12/22, 1:03 PM - Ashu: Yeah I had just woken up lol
3/12/22, 1:12 PM - Ashu: So we talked with Dr and nurses on visitors and going out. Plus covid complicates even more. 
There is currently no evidence that babies can get covid immunity from mother’s immunization. And vaccine not yet authorized for less than 5 years or so. 
The recommendations are to avoid visitors for up to 6 weeks for baby’s immunity to catch up. Then follow covid regulations (masks, sanitizer, distance)
3/12/22, 1:27 PM - Padam Jain: 👍
3/12/22, 1:38 PM - Ashu: <Media omitted>
3/12/22, 1:39 PM - Vibhu: Where is Nila in photos ?
3/12/22, 1:39 PM - Ashu: Looks like NiLa or me? 😀
3/12/22, 1:40 PM - Ashu: When she has the baby, I am running around (and sleeping); when I have the baby she gets a chance to click pics 🤣
3/12/22, 1:41 PM - Vibhu: We need to change the order .. she needs to sleep and you need to click
3/12/22, 1:41 PM - Vibhu: She looks exactly like Anika
3/12/22, 1:44 PM - Rashi: Exactly :)
3/12/22, 1:47 PM - Shalini Antil: Oww so cute 😍
3/12/22, 1:47 PM - Shalini Antil: I think she looks like nila
3/12/22, 1:47 PM - Shalini Antil: 😄
3/12/22, 1:47 PM - Ashu: 😩
Nila says she is a copy of me
3/12/22, 1:48 PM - Shalini Antil: Hahha .. i don't think so
3/12/22, 1:48 PM - Ashu: Future gulab jamun only for people who say she looks like me 😜🤣
3/12/22, 1:51 PM - Padam Jain: I don't remember any past gulab jamuns ,🤔
3/12/22, 2:00 PM - Vibhu: Ashu looks like Anika. 
Would I be still eligible for gulab jamun ?
3/12/22, 2:09 PM - Shalini Antil: Haha.. then i shud take my words back.. i like sweets more than fruits 😄 sorry nila 😅
3/12/22, 2:11 PM - Ashu: As they say on Wall Street funds, past performance is not a good indicator of future returns
3/12/22, 2:12 PM - Ashu: Nah, you two have to wait for Anika to grow up and share gulab jamun now that you ruled out both Nila and me 😜
3/12/22, 3:14 PM - Vibhu: Considering Nila and Ashu’s love and appetite for gulab jamun, I am better off investing in the future. 
I can already see my efforts giving fruits with Yuvi.
3/12/22, 3:16 PM - Ashu: Btw, you can always visit me (from distance) 🤪
3/12/22, 3:17 PM - Ashu: So you are saying Anika looks a lot like me?
3/12/22, 3:21 PM - Vibhu: that I will wait for Anika to grow up and secure my future relishing every gulab jamun with her, on metaverse  or   next generation fad
3/12/22, 4:12 PM - Padam Jain: Vibhu/Rashi- Is TV project done?
3/12/22, 4:17 PM - Rashi: Not yet
3/12/22, 4:56 PM - Padam Jain: All the offers still on the table?
3/12/22, 4:56 PM - Vibhu: Would definitely need a helping pair of hands to install that monster
3/12/22, 4:57 PM - Vibhu: If you are free tomorrow, I can get a 6 pack and 12 pack (gulab jamun)
3/12/22, 5:05 PM - Padam Jain: Want to do it now? I am already out
3/12/22, 6:37 PM - Nila Le: Hahaha, it’s OK Shalini!!
3/12/22, 6:38 PM - Nila Le: @everyone — I confirmed that both my mom and I think Anika is Ashu’s copy. I am only the photocopy machine 😂. I don’t like sweet so his bribing doesn’t work on me.
3/12/22, 6:41 PM - Padam Jain: What happen to Jalebi and rabri
3/12/22, 9:32 PM - Ashu: Let me know when jalebi and rabri are ready; I can always drop by for few minutes :P
3/12/22, 11:15 PM - Leanne: Umm am I missing something... She clearly looks like ni la?! Sorry ashu.. I like sweets but I hate gulab jamuns 😅🤢
3/12/22, 11:22 PM - Ashu: No donuts for you 🤪
3/13/22, 11:18 AM - Ashu: <Media omitted>
3/13/22, 11:20 AM - Leanne: 👍👍👍 looks like doctor bored her 😅
3/13/22, 11:20 AM - Ashu: 🤣
3/13/22, 12:05 PM - Nila Le: Hahaha no, I had to feed her for them to weigh her before and after, so my milk bored her 😍😍😍

3/14/22, 11:37 AM - Rashi: Question: clearly messaged slides vs detailed write up .. which one is more tedious and time consuming ?
3/14/22, 11:55 AM - Vibhu: Clearly messaged slides with all the fonts and colors to the likings of Coco Chanel is more tedious and time consuming than detailed crappy write up
3/14/22, 11:56 AM - Padam Jain: Who is Coco Chanel?
3/14/22, 12:02 PM - Vibhu: Sumit batayega 😝
You can continue to watch cocomelon
3/14/22, 12:05 PM - Padam Jain: I thought you meant cocomelon and typed wrong. Put Cocomelon there and your sentence will make a perfect sense
3/14/22, 12:07 PM - Ashu: “I wrote a 10 page report since I didn’t time to write a one page report “
3/14/22, 12:10 PM - Ashu: Who’s coco melon and coco Chanel?
3/14/22, 12:10 PM - Rashi: You will know soon!
3/14/22, 12:10 PM - Rashi: Wait for 6 months
3/14/22, 12:10 PM - Vibhu: So less tedious and more time consuming 😛
We need 4 Quadrant analysis with two axes of time and tedious. Can somebody make a clear slide or a Detailed report on analysis
3/14/22, 12:11 PM - Rashi: I was thinking about that. My question should have 4 quadrants
3/14/22, 12:11 PM - Ashu: Typical manager 
Asking others to do the work
3/14/22, 12:11 PM - Rashi: I think my intention of question was to know which one is less draining
3/14/22, 12:11 PM - Vibhu: That’s the left hottom quadrant
3/14/22, 12:11 PM - Rashi: I fear report
3/14/22, 12:11 PM - Rashi: I don’t mind slides
3/14/22, 12:12 PM - Ashu: Less draining for laptop battery or brain battery?
3/14/22, 12:12 PM - Rashi: But it takes a lot of time to get to right ones with clear message
3/14/22, 12:12 PM - Rashi: Brain :)
3/14/22, 12:13 PM - Rashi: When looking at switching jobs, I think this should be one of a big criterias for pros and cons if someone stands behind one idea strongly
3/14/22, 12:13 PM - Ashu: Pls elaborate further
3/14/22, 12:13 PM - Rashi: Over scotch 😂
3/14/22, 12:14 PM - Rashi: It was a general comment
3/14/22, 12:15 PM - Vibhu: I am standing behind the idea of getting more money very strongly, but unable to switch the jobs
3/14/22, 12:15 PM - Rashi: Haha
3/14/22, 12:15 PM - Rashi: That will be a strong pro if trade off of higher
3/14/22, 12:16 PM - Rashi: I took decision making class this quarter .. 😂
3/14/22, 12:16 PM - Ashu: Over rabdi
Over jalebi
Over scotch 

Your to-do list is increasing
3/14/22, 12:16 PM - Vibhu: Or let me rephrase … idea if getting more money with less work
3/14/22, 12:16 PM - Rashi: Haha. Kal shaam aajao
3/14/22, 12:16 PM - Rashi: If Jindal is free and around too
3/14/22, 12:17 PM - Rashi: Scotch done! Jalebi ke lie first vibhu has to eat 12 GJ save syrup 😂
3/14/22, 12:18 PM - Rashi: When can we see Anika
3/14/22, 12:18 PM - Ashu: That’s the age old $/effort maximizing
3/14/22, 12:19 PM - Ashu: After 6 weeks
3/14/22, 12:19 PM - Rashi: Okkk
3/14/22, 12:19 PM - Rashi: Be a giant and then consult. Life will be chill
3/14/22, 12:19 PM - Rashi: Giant in a field*
3/14/22, 12:20 PM - Rashi: Which vibhu you can
3/14/22, 12:20 PM - Rashi: Just that start charging for consultancy
3/14/22, 12:20 PM - Vibhu: Cumulative $/work time is terrible
3/14/22, 12:21 PM - Rashi: All slide preparing people responded. Where is our document writer!!
3/14/22, 12:21 PM - Padam Jain: How about work time  = 0? Return is infinite then
3/14/22, 12:22 PM - Vibhu: Looks like Sumit is either getting into amazon work culture or watching amazon prime
3/14/22, 12:22 PM - Rashi: 😂😈
3/14/22, 12:22 PM - Vibhu: Only if $ >0
Retirement in India on pension
3/14/22, 12:22 PM - Vibhu: 0/0 is unknown not infinity
3/14/22, 12:22 PM - Padam Jain: I will give you $1 a month
3/14/22, 12:23 PM - Padam Jain: Infinity now?
3/14/22, 12:26 PM - Vibhu: Ummm .. I need to offset 0 with minimum living 😁
3/14/22, 12:46 PM - Sumit: Not sure why this question is relevant .. who cares if it is tedious and time consuming for you 😜. All that matters - who the audience is? Drive for customer obsessions!!  .. if customers like slides, do slides; if customers like to know details, do that; if customer is dumb and clueless then just stick with slides 😂
3/14/22, 12:46 PM - Vibhu: <Media omitted>

3/14/22, 12:48 PM - Padam Jain: Has Amazon developed some customers first medicine that they inject in employees?
3/14/22, 12:49 PM - Ashu: To that Apple employees will say, customers do not know what is best for them, so it is left us to give them the best experience
3/14/22, 12:50 PM - Ashu: It’s In their new employee training

3/18/22, 10:48 AM - Sumit: I don’t think you can deny that mental health is a growing issue and all these technologies are aid to that problem - this is what I meant for destruction.

3/18/22, 6:17 PM - Ashu: I charged 120 miles today in 40 minutes, currently free, but ~$20 otherwise
3/18/22, 6:18 PM - Ashu: Otherwise it takes 6-7 hours at office, free. 
Or 3-4 days at home 110V and ~$15 electricity
3/18/22, 6:19 PM - Ashu: Can install a 220V from dryer outlet to charge in 6-7 hours at home, same cost $15

3/22/22, 4:11 PM - Ashu: There are a few reasons why gas prices can vary from state to state. State taxes play a big role in the final price at the pump, and they can range from 57.6¢ per gallon in Pennsylvania to 8¢ per gallon in Alaska.

Proximity to refineries is another contributing factor for cheaper gas. States like Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama often have lower prices than other regions.

3/28/22, 11:58 AM - Vibhu: Slapping to start with itself was not justified .. should people start slapping comedian for every joke they make. Because every joke will upset somebody irrespective of how bad or low the joke is
3/28/22, 12:01 PM - Padam Jain: I think will was high and drunk. His winning speech was not making any sense

3/31/22, 9:42 AM - Padam Jain: It is meta mates? Not Metaites or metaers?
3/31/22, 9:42 AM - Ashu: Are they for real? Or just meta?
3/31/22, 9:44 AM - Ashu: One of Meta's many new corporate values is "Meta, Metamates, me."

Contrast this with Amazon values
3/31/22, 9:50 AM - Rashi: 😂

4/1/22, 6:25 PM - Sumit: I need to do taxes this weekend and I am extra nervous to see how much I would need to pay 😰…
4/1/22, 6:27 PM - Ashu: Btw desktop version of TurboTax doesn’t accurately reflect tax numbers until you run through until very end at least once, including state section. Not sure how the online version does it. Could be the source of discrepancy.
4/1/22, 6:34 PM - Sumit: Yeah online is real time so that explains the disprepency

https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-fire-home-depot-san-jose-visible-space
4/10/22, 5:22 PM - Padam Jain: Visible from space!!!
4/10/22, 5:26 PM - Sumit: Ukraine on fire should be visible from another galaxy !!
4/10/22, 6:00 PM - Ashu: “People should read the bill: https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2932
What it says is that overtime for employees subject to overtime laws get the benefits after 32 hours instead of 40. If you don't get overtime this doesn't affect you. If you do get overtime it means you'll earn a little more for 40 hours of work than you did before, unless your hours get cut to 32.
Employers with OT employees will cut to 32 hours and aim to increase head count 25% to compensate. They'd be paying for the same number of hours but they'd all be regular time and not OT.”

Another dud by dems.

5/4/22, 2:27 PM - Ashu: Now vibhu only shares instagram links ; no more YT video links? :P
5/4/22, 9:05 PM - Ashu: Some concepts I have been applying lately:
-Fishbone for mapping out root cause possibilities 
-Commonality analysis across multiple variables 
-Design of experiments for improving output 
-Single point of failure and redundancy
5/4/22, 9:07 PM - Ashu: Problem statement: why does she stop bottle leaving exactly 40 mL left in bottle every time 😩
5/4/22, 9:11 PM - Padam Jain: Have you looked at the angel of bottle when you hold it? Is it consistent all the time?
5/4/22, 9:11 PM - Ashu: Yep
5/4/22, 9:12 PM - Padam Jain: Yep to first or second question
5/4/22, 9:12 PM - Padam Jain: ?
5/4/22, 9:14 PM - Ashu: Both
And looked at milk temperature, milk age, her angle, bottle angle, different bottles, different flow nipples, different material…

It started few days ago; prior to that no issues so it’s baffling
5/4/22, 9:15 PM - Ashu: How are you doing today
5/4/22, 9:18 PM - Leanne: I feel like Evi did that? Like after there's not enough gravity pressure they are like... Meh
5/4/22, 9:18 PM - Leanne: Don't think there's much that can be done.. just annoying.. we got pretty open-minded about saving milk.....
5/4/22, 9:19 PM - Ashu: Yeah 
We tried to change flow rate nipple to make it easier for final40 but no dice
5/4/22, 9:19 PM - Leanne: Lol only 8 weeks and already going against your wishes 😅
5/4/22, 9:20 PM - Ashu: Yeah 
Definitely takes after Nila as you all say 
😜🤣
5/4/22, 9:20 PM - Leanne: 😂😂is it true ni la?
5/5/22, 10:30 AM - Nila Le: Haha, it’s a trick question / paradox. If I say No, isn’t it an evident that I went against Ashu’s opinion, which proves he’s right? 😜
5/5/22, 10:37 AM - Leanne: And if you say yes? 🤔
5/5/22, 10:38 AM - Nila Le: Haha then it is not truthful to my awareness a🤪
5/5/22, 10:54 AM - Ashu: 🤭
5/5/22, 11:11 AM - Leanne: 😂😂
5/5/22, 12:17 PM - Vibhu: Why not put 40 ml more every tine and not worry about it
5/5/22, 12:24 PM - Nila Le: We thought about it, but 2 caveats. We will waste 40 mL of breast milk every feeding (or else take LeAnne’s advice to not worry too much about saving milk 😛).  And manufacturers don’t have a good size bottle for 160 mL (only 120, 150, or 240) 😭
5/5/22, 12:27 PM - Vibhu: Is adding  that 40ml leftover to next batch a possibility
5/5/22, 12:27 PM - Leanne: Omg girl we gave it up... We just stuck it in the fridge and used it next time..couldn't deal with the milk waste. Both girls never got food poisoning from a little contaminated milk 🤔 🤷 with Anaya I felt worried and guilty, but thankfully by the time we had Evi I was over it and blissfully unstressed 😅
5/5/22, 12:28 PM - Leanne: The issue vibhu is that once she sucks on it, it's "contaminated" and supposed to be used within the hour or thrown
5/5/22, 12:32 PM - Nila Le: Lol second kid 😂
5/5/22, 12:58 PM - Ashu: Looks like we need a whiteboard for Friday evening ...
5/5/22, 5:32 PM - Ashu: Event rescheduled due to peeps working too hard in NYC; and drinking too much wine and getting sore throat/fever
5/5/22, 5:34 PM - Padam Jain: Covid?
5/5/22, 5:34 PM - Padam Jain: Sumit, are you better now?
5/5/22, 5:35 PM - Sumit: Negative home test but awaiting pcr test results tomorrow

5/6/22, 12:01 PM - Padam Jain: I still have loyalty to Google due to already vested stocks
5/6/22, 12:03 PM - Ashu: Just curious 🤨 how loyal you are to google

Interesting premise- millionaire quiz show but - you either know the correct answer or you convince you are correct by bullshitting !!
5/9/22, 8:32 AM - Sumit: SPY below 400 !!
5/9/22, 8:45 AM - Ashu: Vibhu still saying it’s just variations?
5/9/22, 8:45 AM - Vibhu: Not variation anymore
5/9/22, 8:46 AM - Vibhu: But it’s bottom most
5/9/22, 8:46 AM - Vibhu: It will only go up from here
5/9/22, 8:46 AM - Vibhu: I would be buying today if I can get time in office
5/9/22, 8:50 AM - Sumit: I think we are headed for recession so this is not the bottom..
5/9/22, 8:52 AM - Ashu: Even it falls to 350 Vibhu will say it’s bottom same as today , just a bit of variation 🤣
5/9/22, 8:58 AM - Sumit: You would be buying today if you really believed in buying today. Time can’t be an excuse 😜

5/13/22, 8:31 AM - Padam Jain: I think so
5/13/22, 8:31 AM - Padam Jain: This is the house across our house
5/13/22, 8:38 AM - Sumit: Wow looks awesome !!
5/13/22, 8:39 AM - Padam Jain: Good, first step is cleared. Got you excited.
5/13/22, 8:40 AM - Rashi: Very modern

5/13/22, 9:01 AM - Leanne: Anaya would be so happy to have 'raj and yuvi across the street 😅
5/13/22, 9:02 AM - Sumit: Congrats… are you suggesting for a party in the evening?
5/13/22, 9:02 AM - Ashu: Don’t forget we have access to better free food now at meta!!
5/13/22, 9:02 AM - Padam Jain: Yep, net sum is zero now. Well balances Vibhu
5/13/22, 9:03 AM - Sumit: When is lunch at meta? Without checking we can’t say it’s better
5/13/22, 9:04 AM - Padam Jain: Let's have lunch there before they stop giving free food
5/13/22, 9:35 AM - Rashi: So interestingly we will all have to go all the way to Burlingame to get good food. Sunnyvale campus food sucks
5/13/22, 9:48 AM - Padam Jain: That is too much commitment for free food
5/13/22, 9:56 AM - Sumit: I can compromise with sunnyvale food 🤓

5/13/22, 3:53 PM - Ashu: Next week is quite challenging for me to step out :D
5/13/22, 3:54 PM - Ashu: NiLa - I am going to charge car at Westfield Oakridge (and while car is charging meet Vibhu n all for a drink) :D
5/13/22, 3:55 PM - Padam Jain: Don't you need to charge the car very often next week?

5/14/22, 3:59 PM - Sumit: Hardware sucks !!

Sounds about right
5/14/22, 7:16 PM - Ashu: Any recommendations for a quiet battery operated vacuum? Anika wakes up startled with loudish noises now 🥲
5/14/22, 7:17 PM - Vibhu: You have no carpet right .. try iRobot braava
5/14/22, 7:18 PM - Vibhu: It’s mopper rather than vacuum robot
5/14/22, 7:19 PM - Vibhu: Stop by home for demo
5/14/22, 7:51 PM - Rashi: Vacuum when she is up? Just an option
5/14/22, 8:35 PM - Ashu: Nah, robot vacuum are super slow. Great when you are out of home.
5/14/22, 8:37 PM - Ashu: Yeah, need something to vacuum quick while she is awake. I dare not run a vacuum in same room as her when she’s sleeping 🤣
5/14/22, 8:38 PM - Ashu: My mop vacuum isn’t too loud but neato is. So need a non-mop non-robot battery powered quiet vacuum 😩🤷‍♂️
5/14/22, 9:08 PM - Rashi: Dyson?
5/15/22, 12:52 AM - Ashu: Is the midrange dyson good enough for hard floor? I will look into it.

5/16/22, 9:21 AM - Ashu: Is that Vibhu’s pic?
5/16/22, 9:22 AM - Ashu: Matrix will be reality soon going by this direction
5/16/22, 9:23 AM - Padam Jain: We can all blame on Vibhu for the destruction of the civilization
5/16/22, 10:05 AM - Vibhu: There is always rising of new civilization from the Ashes of old
5/16/22, 10:08 AM - Vibhu: All that is there .. haptic suits, in-canal microphones
5/16/22, 10:17 AM - Padam Jain: Is it from Meta's internal memo?
5/16/22, 11:52 AM - Vibhu: MBA folks - when valuing startups are you guys putting multipliers on ARR/Revenue or EBITDA
5/16/22, 11:58 AM - Sumit: There are many ways to do valuation… EBITDA multiple is fastest way but good comparables are difficult to find. The best is free cash flow based valuation (APV or WACC) but takes time and lot of details.
5/16/22, 12:00 PM - Sumit: I’ll send you couple of valuation project - apple and another firm that we did.
5/16/22, 12:02 PM - Padam Jain: Can you do it for Rivian?
5/16/22, 12:05 PM - Sumit: Hahaha.. if someone is paying me for it 😂
5/16/22, 12:07 PM - Vibhu: Yeah but startups generally don’t have positive cash flow or  EBITDA … 
so if comparing two approaches  - ARR vs cash flow  .: for a growth  startup -  multiplier of ~15 on ARR is common .. but what’s the typical range of multiplier in cash flow .. as startups don’t have that good cash flow
5/16/22, 12:07 PM - Sumit: Doing valuation is easy.. being right all the time is difficult 😜 as valuation is all supply-demand based ultimately
5/16/22, 12:09 PM - Vibhu: I mean at what stage of startup valuation starts changing from multiplier on ARR vs multiplier on cash flow .. and how to find comparable multipliers on cash flow (can’t compare with public companies using P/E)
5/16/22, 12:10 PM - Sumit: You have to project future cash flows but that is also lot of hand waving obviously
5/16/22, 12:11 PM - Vibhu: Ok 👍
5/16/22, 12:12 PM - Sumit: Startup valuation is tied to VC pre-money/post-money… valuation depends on how much fund they are willing to deploy and how much they believe the company should be worth for.
5/16/22, 12:13 PM - Sumit: There is nothing called cash flow multiples… future free cash flow need to be discounted to present value to determine valuation
5/16/22, 12:15 PM - Rashi: I also have a model from my fin class. Should I share that 🤓
5/16/22, 12:15 PM - Sumit: The trick is finding out discount factors, debt to equity forecasts etc so there are lot of assumption so any valuation is just paper exercise to justify the valuation in proximity of where it should be.
5/16/22, 12:16 PM - Rashi: Time for meeting over scotch
5/16/22, 12:19 PM - Sumit: Correction - ‘should be’ —> ‘where you want it to be or where the general consensus it should be’ 😂
5/16/22, 12:43 PM - Ashu: Please share!
5/16/22, 12:44 PM - Ashu: Yes 👍
5/16/22, 12:45 PM - Ashu: All of valuation is more of an art than science 
And if you can convince others that your assumptions are valid (cash flows, comparables, etc) then your model ‘works’
5/16/22, 12:47 PM - Ashu: I did WDC at the time, and predicted $110/share based on optimistic assumptions on market growth and WAC’s market share to drive revenue predictions 
It reached 120 I think before tanking
5/16/22, 12:54 PM - Padam Jain: MBA: Masters in Business and Arts 😜
5/16/22, 12:54 PM - Padam Jain: I will be unemployed for a week. Please bear with me
5/16/22, 12:55 PM - Vibhu: Should have been Master of Arts in business

5/18/22, 9:55 PM - Sumit: $15 mein kya kya loge … free shipping, free video, free music, free  games, free cloud storage…
5/18/22, 9:56 PM - Sumit: Netflix only does one thing in that money
5/18/22, 9:56 PM - Ashu: <Cough> customer centric <cough>
5/18/22, 9:57 PM - Ashu: Prime video is a free product (free with Amazon prime)
Netflix is a paid subscription
5/18/22, 9:57 PM - Sumit: You can’t target all type of customers all the time 😜
5/18/22, 9:59 PM - Vibhu: Mei to sirf better recommendations maang raha hoo 🥺
5/18/22, 9:59 PM - Ashu: TikTok has the best recommendations algorithms I believe

5/20/22, 10:42 AM - Padam Jain: Kidney was for iphone. AR/VR might require more. Article says $3k

5/24/22, 8:51 AM - Sumit: At 3000 S&P we will be officially in recession as per some bank analysts so not sure what a fair value means in this chart.
5/24/22, 9:29 AM - Padam Jain: Does the historical p/e based s&p analysis make sense when it is dominated by few companies and they are growing healthy YoY?
5/24/22, 9:41 AM - Vibhu: ^^^
5/24/22, 9:42 AM - Vibhu: That gives P/E of 15. 
Big tech companies in S&P are growing with 25%. Many others at 15% or so
5/24/22, 9:43 AM - Vibhu: So why PE should double
5/24/22, 10:13 AM - Sumit: Currently S&P500 index is at 3900 with SPY at 390. SPY tracks the index very closely. If a fair value of 3000 is assumed as bottom for S&P500 index in the downward trend/recession market then SPY fair value  should be at 300 so that would mean the bottom for SPY is much below than 375.

5/24/22, 2:16 PM - Padam Jain: What are the thoughts from you guys about ESPP contribution? Should I max it out? It is 15% discount
5/24/22, 2:18 PM - Ashu: Isn’t it guaranteed 15% profit at vest even if stock is falling? Like intel.
5/24/22, 2:19 PM - Padam Jain: It is going back 2 years
5/24/22, 2:19 PM - Padam Jain: 4 cycles
5/24/22, 2:30 PM - Sumit: ESPP discount is free money regardless of the stock performance.
5/24/22, 2:30 PM - Ashu: So lowest in 4 cycles?

6/1/22, 7:56 PM - Ashu: How about a park picnic? Beer, that-old-people-tennis-sport, playground, shade …
6/1/22, 8:12 PM - Ashu: Oh wait, you meant the other jain household 🤣
Up to you. 
Okay with either park or your place.
6/1/22, 9:43 PM - Leanne: Lol!!!! Hahaha no I don't suggest the family with newborn for father's day celebration 😂😂😅
6/1/22, 9:44 PM - Leanne: Yes I was talking about our house 😅 park sounds fun too ... Whoever has preferences can suggest

6/13/22, 4:44 PM - Padam Jain: How do you know she is Punjabi? Just because she is in Punjab?
6/13/22, 5:25 PM - Sumit: Punjabi usually have same name for boy and girl so that’s my guess !
6/13/22, 9:04 PM - Padam Jain: I see. Makes sense. Jindals seems to be a widespread community. Punjab to San Jose

6/14/22, 7:40 PM - Rashi: Why do you think the treadmill is 100%accurate. Genuinely asking not as apple employee 😂
6/14/22, 7:41 PM - Sumit: Because I feel I didn’t run 3 miles 😜
6/14/22, 7:41 PM - Rashi: Ok “feel” is the metrics here :)
6/14/22, 7:41 PM - Sumit: Anyway I’ll test on other machine
6/14/22, 7:42 PM - Rashi: Yea I know Apple Watch has 10% inaccuracy.
6/14/22, 7:42 PM - Rashi: Just from hikes and mile markers
6/14/22, 7:46 PM - Sumit: I walled for 15 min in 30 min .. on treadmill it would take me 25-30min to run 3 mile based on past data points so this is not purely based on feeling.
6/14/22, 7:47 PM - Sumit: *walked
6/14/22, 7:56 PM - Padam Jain: I wonder if Apple does a binning of watches based on callibration offset
6/14/22, 8:12 PM - Sumit: I think if you are doing mix of walking + running then the error would likely exaggerate because watch just calculates distance based on hand movement (or GPS) and run calibration. Treadmill would measure right because it’s just based on belt rotation.
6/14/22, 8:14 PM - Sumit: We need intelligent ML in watches that can also take into account heart rate profile to switch between workouts or recalibrate distance accordingly.
6/14/22, 8:15 PM - Ashu: ML is getting sentient lately 
Maybe it will also push you like a trainer until you collapse
6/14/22, 8:20 PM - Sumit: Hahaha
6/14/22, 8:21 PM - Rashi: Try strava. It is pretty good with measuremnt and see what error it comes to
6/14/22, 8:22 PM - Ashu: Is there Amazon fire fitness?
With the Amazon band?
6/14/22, 8:23 PM - Rashi: Also check what body weight you have fed into health .. Watch takes that into account when calculating calories burned
6/14/22, 8:28 PM - Sumit: Not sure why strava would be any different than apple watch measurement for indoor treadmill workout because the measurement would be based on arm movement/accelerometer which is hardware based mechanism.
6/14/22, 8:29 PM - Sumit: For outdoor run, strava and apple watch would match close as both can use GPS for distance measurement
6/14/22, 8:29 PM - Rashi: Hmm I am just surprised why indoor is so off.
6/14/22, 8:33 PM - Sumit: Yeah there is halo health and wellness membership.. though not sure how many use it 😂
6/14/22, 9:48 PM - Ashu: You need to lead by example
6/14/22, 9:53 PM - Rashi: Sumit did you lose power too?
6/14/22, 9:56 PM - Ashu: He’s powering treadmill
6/14/22, 9:56 PM - Rashi: No wonder I lost it for 1.5hr
6/14/22, 9:56 PM - Rashi: Sumit bohot daud liye
6/14/22, 10:12 PM - Sumit: No we didn’t lose power

6/15/22, 11:09 AM - Sumit: Aricle written about a year ago predicting about inflation and Fed’s slowness to deal with it.
6/15/22, 11:21 AM - Vibhu: Though I agree, the irrationality in the market is too much currently  to try to make any sense
6/15/22, 11:21 AM - Vibhu: Ntlx roku got 10% bump because fed did what they told to do
6/15/22, 11:21 AM - Sumit: Certainly good article and agreed tough job for Fed but having tools to control inflation doesn’t mean it’s done right !!! It’s certain now that US is heading for recession… layoffs happening, interest rate going yo be sky rocketing, housing market will get impacted, GDP will shrink..
6/15/22, 11:23 AM - Vibhu: I still don’t think we will have a recession
6/15/22, 11:23 AM - Sumit: To add .. the russia Ukraine war is not going to end until end of next year so oil pricing will go more up - some even predicting $150-$200 a barrel so that will be a another hammer to economy
6/15/22, 11:24 AM - Sumit: You predicted russia Ukraine war will end in a month or two 😜
6/15/22, 11:24 AM - Vibhu: Yeah that’s the bigger problem - Russia war and oil price
6/15/22, 11:25 AM - Sumit: This is short term… every company is suffering with growth so increase is stock is not going to be a lot this year
6/15/22, 11:27 AM - Vibhu: Russia missed the opportunity to call a win and go home .. they need to show to their people that they win. 
Now it can only happen with annex which is very long process
6/15/22, 11:28 AM - Vibhu: Surprisingly Biden hasn’t increased US oil output. I think he is waiting for summers to pass and then increase to get the price down before mid term
6/15/22, 11:34 AM - Ashu: If they can regain even half their lost amount that would be great

Not Bernie for sure
6/15/22, 11:36 AM - Vibhu: Everyone knows Biden won’t contest again except Biden. 
Key is to hold on house else it will be a mess again for 2 years untill some sensible republican (hopefully) will come and win in 2024
6/15/22, 11:36 AM - Ashu: Three quarters increase in rate???

6/15/22, 11:37 AM - Sumit: Netflix roku didn’t get the bump because of Fed but because netflix is looking to buy Roku !!

6/15/22, 11:38 AM - Ashu: Effects of market sentiment?
6/15/22, 11:40 AM - Sumit: Cheap stock, low growth prospects in streaming market until you consolidate so best time to buy with this deal news again heating up..
6/15/22, 2:09 PM - Vibhu: Our house is currently competing between apple, google, meta and Amazon on # of devices and active device usage time (not app usage time). 
For example google nest hub doesn’t count when running in background unless I actively engage. 

Apple both in #devices and usage time is order of magnitude more than second (google) in list. 
Meta has beaten Amazon on both #devices and device usage time.

6/16/22, 10:04 AM - Padam Jain: Is there a hard definition of recession?
6/16/22, 10:13 AM - Sumit: 3-4 quarters of slowed growth
6/16/22, 10:15 AM - Sumit: So officially expect recession next year. Until then market will just flip flop.
6/16/22, 10:39 AM - Ashu: 2 quarter-ve gdp?
6/16/22, 10:48 AM - Vibhu: Yup .. based on gdp and not on stock market …
6/16/22, 10:49 AM - Sumit: I think GDP is already on decline across the board. Nowadays monthly indicators are more closely weighed to call official recession.
6/16/22, 10:52 AM - Sumit: All monthly indicators except employment were already showing the trend for last 3 months. Unemployment will start to show up in next 3 months or so as it usually follows slow economic activity.

6/21/22, 2:17 PM - Rashi: Apple atleast made it to top 10
6/21/22, 3:19 PM - Vibhu: Exactly - no#1 company to make you work.
6/21/22, 3:20 PM - Vibhu: Meta is #1 company if you don’t want to work
6/21/22, 3:21 PM - Sumit: You think apple makes people work less 😂
6/21/22, 3:22 PM - Vibhu: That’s why they are there in top 10
6/21/22, 3:25 PM - Sumit: But the question is why not at #1 😜
6/21/22, 3:25 PM - Sumit: Or below google
6/21/22, 3:25 PM - Padam Jain: Based on the data source, one conclusion I have is Amzon employee spend a lot of time on LinkedIn and updating their job titles frequently

6/21/22, 6:06 PM - Vibhu: So if oil and food (geopolitical factors) and supply chain problems are resolved, inflation may not be as bad as it seems
6/21/22, 8:52 PM - Padam Jain: I assume these are the prices of raw materials. I am not sure if current inflation is driven by raw materials pricing or the labor that converts these raw materials into end products. My thinking is it is the combination of shortage of labor and expensive labor
6/21/22, 9:01 PM - Sumit: Usually Fed money infusion is the number one reason for inflation but this inflation is worse with both demand and cost side of inflation also playing a key role!!
6/21/22, 9:06 PM - Ashu: Fed money increases demand 
Labor shortage reduced supply
6/21/22, 9:34 PM - Sumit: That would be the usual effect of Fed money but demand and supply were double whammy due to covid this time.
6/23/22, 8:47 AM - Vibhu: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/21/opinion/inflation-interest-rates-fed.html?smid=url-share

6/23/22, 1:09 PM - Padam Jain: It you read it 🙂
6/23/22, 2:14 PM - Ashu: He was hoping sumit will summarize

6/23/22, 3:25 PM - Padam Jain: Nobel
6/23/22, 3:25 PM - Sumit: Why he is beating the drum around cheap money era coming back? I don’t think that is of concern to anyone in long term.
6/23/22, 3:27 PM - Padam Jain: Haven't read the article yet. Unlike Vibhu I try to read and not wait for someone else to summarize 😜
6/23/22, 3:39 PM - Sumit: His key point is that bubble or boom can happen in high interest rate time.. I don’t think there is any denial on this point as there are other factors that can help the boom cycle. I believe the main concern currently is that applying breaks hard (the high interest rate) has an effect on the economy in short term. Everyone is worried about the period until the end of next year and I think he also stated that inflation should come down by end of next year and Fed will start to lower down the interest rate again so no one is disputing what he is saying!
6/23/22, 3:45 PM - Vibhu: If both inflation (interest rate)  and recession (supply chain issues) are resolved by at end of the year, then let’s stop worrying about stock market price  and chill ..
6/23/22, 3:45 PM - Vibhu: Btw Ashu- SPY still holding 375 line

6/23/22, 4:51 PM - Vibhu: Amazing video. 
I wished that this video was available 15 years back when I was Trying to convince Rashi and Ashu that my spending is nothing but income … and I was labeled a radical and illogical person
6/23/22, 4:55 PM - Rashi: Because of you there is 50trilkion credit and only 3trillion cash 😂
6/23/22, 4:55 PM - Rashi: But yea really good video!

7/6/22, 2:26 PM - Ashu: You said you are also close by

7/6/22, 2:57 PM - Sumit: Even the whereabouts of apple employee is confidential info !!
7/6/22, 3:05 PM - Rashi: Arre. There is a red big dot .. towards the bottom
7/6/22, 3:06 PM - Rashi: Your statement however is true 😝

7/6/22, 5:17 PM - Vibhu: Made login today. Grubhub came out to be costlier than DoorDash (with chase)
7/6/22, 5:20 PM - Sumit: <Media omitted>
7/6/22, 5:22 PM - Sumit: Depends in which restaurants you order from - I found grubhub and ubereats to be cheaper sometime than doordash.
7/6/22, 5:24 PM - Sumit: Each one of them have different ecosystem of restaurant partnerships so fees vary
7/6/22, 5:32 PM - Rashi: Ye sab to theek hai. Grocery delivery par $10 kyu hai 😩
7/6/22, 5:32 PM - Rashi: Even Indian grocery stores have started $10 fees irrespective of amount
7/7/22, 6:00 AM - Vibhu: For you Ashu

7/7/22, 11:56 AM - Sumit: Anyone expecting Semi stocks expected to do come with better earning starting next week?
7/7/22, 11:57 AM - Sumit: TSMC is still running healthy and raising prices again in 2023 !!
7/7/22, 11:57 AM - Sumit: Samsung have better earning guidance
7/7/22, 11:58 AM - Padam Jain: Between Micron and Samsung, very mixed messages.
7/7/22, 12:09 PM - Sumit: How abt nvda?
7/7/22, 12:11 PM - Padam Jain: We will know in mid Aug. When earning comes
7/7/22, 12:42 PM - Ashu: Can you trust them?
7/9/22, 2:12 PM - Padam Jain: Engadget: Samsung’s next Galaxy S flagship could drop Exynos chips from global variants.
https://www.engadget.com/samsung-may-drop-exynos-chips-from-galaxy-s23-175838796.html?src=rss
7/9/22, 2:15 PM - Padam Jain: I find this very interesting. A company like Samsung with multiple generations of Exynos is not able to keep up with chip performance. Google etc are trying to go this path
7/9/22, 2:16 PM - Vibhu: Who is fabricating Qualcomm chip
7/9/22, 2:16 PM - Vibhu: At 4nm
7/9/22, 2:17 PM - Padam Jain: I think they use both Samsung and TSMC
7/9/22, 2:18 PM - Vibhu: So design variables in performance
7/9/22, 2:20 PM - Padam Jain: I think it is just more than nodes. It is overall all Silicon design innovation ( both have custom arm core). You need to keep investing heavily in custom IPs to really gain performance
7/9/22, 2:22 PM - Padam Jain: My thinking is business models for all the big companies ( Sans Apple) will move away from vertical integration of hardware to sourcing from the best available out there
7/9/22, 2:26 PM - Vibhu: I doubt that … 
I am seeing more of the opposite trend to continue, considering deep pockets, urge to differentiate and perform, consolidation and monopolization in business segment
7/9/22, 2:28 PM - Vibhu: Let me pick an example .. forget the big SOCs but even for small custom ASICs like eye tracking or inference chips etc, big guys are developing and validating  their own IPs.
7/9/22, 2:28 PM - Vibhu: Tier 2 companies will continue the path you are suggesting.
7/9/22, 2:31 PM - Padam Jain: Will work if the companies are willing to invest as heavy as Apple does in Chip  and IP design and have volume to justify that. That's why I found Samsung ( clearly Teir1 in Flagship phones) news interesting. Even they are not able to keep up with Qualcomm whose bread and butter is SOC.
7/9/22, 2:40 PM - Vibhu: Keep convincing Ashu and Sumit to buy from you 🤪
7/9/22, 2:42 PM - Padam Jain: Not sure about them but guys buy a lot already 🙂
7/9/22, 2:43 PM - Padam Jain: When is everyone free for HH?
7/9/22, 2:44 PM - Padam Jain: Ashu, that was not a question for yo
7/9/22, 2:44 PM - Vibhu: 🤪
7/9/22, 2:44 PM - Padam Jain: That will come out as sarcasm for him
7/9/22, 3:10 PM - Ashu: You have not worked with S.LSI, have you?
Else you won’t be wondering
7/9/22, 3:19 PM - Ashu: Volume is only one aspect 
Custom IP integration, competitive edge are of consideration too.
7/9/22, 3:20 PM - Padam Jain: Volume can justify some of the deep investment in the technical aspects
7/9/22, 3:25 PM - Ashu: Padam’s point is pretty valid in consumer space where cost pressures are topmost; not as much in infrastructure. And even in consumer space, deep pockets can turn things around, eventually - what Zuck and Rick O are hoping to do.
7/9/22, 3:28 PM - Padam Jain: Agree. Data center workloads are very company specific and vertical hardware integration works out
7/9/22, 3:33 PM - Ashu: Oculus will compete with apple product in consumer space and HoloLens in commercial retail. They can afford to invest.
7/9/22, 3:34 PM - Ashu: For google phone, there’s only one loyal customer who will continue with pixel no matter the employer so 🤷‍♂️

7/11/22, 9:52 AM - Padam Jain: What is Amazon chime?
7/11/22, 10:06 AM - Sumit: Why do you want to know?
7/11/22, 10:07 AM - Sumit: It’s amazon internal tool for video conferencing - Zoom/Webex equivalent.
7/11/22, 10:08 AM - Padam Jain: That is interesting because I got some email in Nvidia account to join chime. Looked like a spam
7/11/22, 10:09 AM - Padam Jain: It is not a public tool?
7/11/22, 10:12 AM - Sumit: Not public
7/11/22, 10:12 AM - Padam Jain: Ok
7/11/22, 10:12 AM - Sumit: But if you are having meeting with Amazon, Amazon team will prefer to have call via Chime.
7/11/22, 10:13 AM - Padam Jain: Ok I see.
7/11/22, 11:40 AM - Ashu: Once you sign up, the echo in your home will keep chiming ;)
7/11/22, 11:44 AM - Padam Jain: No echo in my home 🙂

Anyone else getting closer to reading glasses?
7/11/22, 8:39 PM - Rashi: I have trouble reading from my watch. So yes May be. 
But when I got my eyes checked they were all good
7/11/22, 8:39 PM - Rashi: We are almost there ..

7/12/22, 4:29 PM - Vibhu: The alternative to drink scotch is even worse

7/12/22, 5:11 PM - Ashu: <Media omitted>
7/12/22, 5:12 PM - Vibhu: Is it after tax or before tax  ?
7/12/22, 5:14 PM - Ashu: 🤣
Should be after-tax

7/13/22, 10:32 AM - Vibhu: And the SPY rises 🤣
7/13/22, 10:33 AM - Sumit: Don’t get fooled with it !!
7/13/22, 10:33 AM - Vibhu: I have stopped  looking at new and stocks as there is no actionable insight in near term. There is neither an opportunity to buy or sell
7/13/22, 10:34 AM - Sumit: Opportunity to buy probably yes if you have cash !!
7/13/22, 10:34 AM - Vibhu: Ukraine war needs to stop followed by oil prices to make any insight on future opportunity
7/13/22, 10:35 AM - Vibhu: I don’t know about that … reports from all tech is saying opposite, preparing for downslide which  can affect overall market
7/13/22, 10:36 AM - Vibhu: Trends at google, Facebook, apple are the reflection of overall sentiments these days
7/13/22, 10:36 AM - Sumit: Hard to catch the bottom
7/13/22, 10:36 AM - Vibhu: So what if it drops further and then comes back to this level after gain or worse takes longer time to gain. Dry powder is further blocked.
7/13/22, 10:37 AM - Vibhu: Exactly. 
So I wouldn’t rate the opportunity (to buy) by bottom but how fast it will gain in near future.
7/13/22, 10:38 AM - Sumit: Downside is always opportunity to buy .. it depends on the risk each individual is looking to take 😜
7/13/22, 10:38 AM - Vibhu: I don’t see a fast gain in near future and hence don’t want to invest. Rather I would sideline and wait for the market to pick up.
7/13/22, 10:38 AM - Vibhu: Given, if I have powder 🤣
7/13/22, 10:40 AM - Vibhu: That’s just difference in investment philosophy. 
One would buy bottom - irrespective of how long it might take to get up.
Other might sacrifice on bottom but would gain on slope  (invest when market is gaining)
7/13/22, 4:25 PM - Sumit: <Media omitted>
7/13/22, 4:26 PM - Sumit: Driving towards Mathilda !!

7/13/22, 4:35 PM - Rashi: Haha dekhte hain
7/13/22, 4:35 PM - Sumit: Rivian production numbers came good
7/13/22, 4:35 PM - Rashi: Reviews says that for the price it is not as luxury
7/13/22, 4:35 PM - Sumit: When is yours coming?
7/13/22, 4:35 PM - Rashi: They haven’t committed anything yet
7/13/22, 4:35 PM - Rashi: Expecting 2023 sometime
7/13/22, 5:52 PM - Ashu: Puts?
7/13/22, 5:53 PM - Ashu: Where is model y? It’s July. Call Elon
7/13/22, 5:56 PM - Vibhu: They were delivering on June 29 but we weren’t here
7/13/22, 5:57 PM - Ashu: They just need to park in your driveway and leave 
Not like you have to sign papers or anything
7/13/22, 5:57 PM - Ashu: With Tesla auto insurance? Or GEICO?
7/13/22, 6:16 PM - Vibhu: They gave  that option. I didn’t want that. If anything happens from then to the time we come, it will be on our insurance rather than figuring out problem out of door vs later
7/13/22, 10:19 PM - Rashi: So I setup two lights with Siri and one light with Google in bedroom. There absolutely no lag between when I say to turn on/off light with Siri vs 1-2 sec delay for Google to execute. 

I have finally started to enjoy the little automations. 😂
7/13/22, 10:44 PM - Sumit: Alexa is in spaceships now.. you are running behind on automations 😜

7/14/22, 8:37 AM - Sumit: Consumers are still buying with hot inflation or they are looking for some reprieve
7/14/22, 8:46 AM - Vibhu: So they posted biggest number of items but not revenue
7/14/22, 8:46 AM - Vibhu: Do you know how revenue (or total sales) compares
7/14/22, 8:47 AM - Vibhu: Buying toilet paper, shampoo, toothpaste because it on sale is not the same as buying TV on sale (3X more items but 10x less $)
7/14/22, 8:48 AM - Sumit: I'll ping Andy Jassy if he can post the revenue numbers :)
7/14/22, 8:49 AM - Sumit: Amazon Devices had a record-breaking Prime Day, selling more devices than any other Prime Day event
7/14/22, 8:50 AM - Sumit: beta for necessary items is very low usually
7/14/22, 9:29 AM - Padam Jain: I can not rely on any of these devices to turn off my TV, space is a stretch.
7/14/22, 9:31 AM - Rashi: Siri does it seamlessly. Turns off lights tv and turns off without a lag. Super impressed.
7/14/22, 9:33 AM - Padam Jain: Google has been confused lately about everything to the point that Anaya calls Google dumb now days
7/14/22, 9:33 AM - Padam Jain: Maybe time to explore a new ecosystem
7/14/22, 11:26 AM - Ashu: Alexa has been the best so far, for years, rock solid
7/14/22, 11:28 AM - Ashu: Siri gets confused half of the time, doesn’t recognize second user in home by voice 
Google sometimes forgets second user; works okay but with limited features availability
7/14/22, 11:28 AM - Ashu: All of the above in home automation context 
Natural language processing is a different ranking
7/14/22, 12:50 PM - Padam Jain: Article says customer saved $1.7B. even with 30% on an average discount, that's about $4B in revenue
7/14/22, 5:08 PM - Padam Jain: Anyone free tonight?
7/14/22, 6:55 PM - Ashu: Depends on what time, and could be 10-30 minutes 😜
7/14/22, 6:57 PM - Padam Jain: Anytime after 8. Have been through the time uncertainty. Always on call 🤣
7/14/22, 9:01 PM - Ashu: Will skip
7/15/22, 8:18 PM - Ashu: Saturday after 8pm?
7/16/22, 10:56 AM - Padam Jain: Works for me. Anyone else?
7/16/22, 3:15 PM - Sumit: I am not sure yet.
7/17/22, 10:59 AM - Ashu: We are going to Cupertino mains; come join if you can
Philz coffee, 85 bakery, boba, ice cream etc options and greens to chill
7/17/22, 11:00 AM - Ashu: We have 1.5 hours wake window to work with 😵‍💫
7/18/22, 12:43 PM - Leanne: Sorry we missed you yesterday Ashu.. my mom was visiting
7/18/22, 12:43 PM - Leanne: Does anyone know an app or other way to track elevation change during a hike?
7/18/22, 12:52 PM - Rashi: Runkeeper, alltrails .. or get a watch. Fitbit might be a good one for android.
7/18/22, 12:53 PM - Rashi: Strava does it too
7/18/22, 1:00 PM - Leanne: Padam got me a watch (off brand) but doesn't seem to do it... Maybe I'm just too lame to figure it out
7/18/22, 1:00 PM - Leanne: But thank you!! Will look into apps
7/18/22, 1:02 PM - Padam Jain: It is not off brand. It is Amazon Band 5. You are insulting Sumit 🤣
7/18/22, 1:02 PM - Leanne: Whoops
7/18/22, 1:02 PM - Leanne: Lol sorry sumit
7/18/22, 1:02 PM - Leanne: It's AmazeFit
7/18/22, 1:03 PM - Leanne: It works great actually 😅
7/18/22, 1:03 PM - Leanne: But it doesn't have gps
7/18/22, 1:21 PM - Ashu: App can use phone gps
Strava, AllTrails (probably subscription) etc
7/18/22, 1:27 PM - Leanne: Excellent will check out ty!
7/18/22, 1:50 PM - Vibhu: Exactly that’s why it doesn’t have the basic features
7/18/22, 1:51 PM - Ashu: And now Apple..

7/18/22, 1:51 PM - Padam Jain: Ok, Apple also jumped in the band wagon for slow hiring
7/18/22, 2:52 PM - Sumit: Stock market seesaw today.. netflix will tank it tomorrow !!
7/18/22, 3:30 PM - Padam Jain: It is always seesaw. Only frequency changes from intraday to 1-2 days
7/18/22, 5:33 PM - Ashu: Where is vibhu?
No recession until spy <375
7/18/22, 6:09 PM - Vibhu: Is SPY below 375 ?
7/18/22, 6:11 PM - Vibhu: <Media omitted>
7/18/22, 6:12 PM - Vibhu: Interpret it which ever way you want
7/18/22, 6:14 PM - Sumit: Which way you are interpreting?
7/18/22, 6:15 PM - Vibhu: Inflation is real. 
Recession (drop in GDP) may not be as significant as people are projecting in panic. The market valuation price is corrected accordingly. 
There is supply/demand unbalance which is causing turmoil. Like I said before Ukraine war (oil price) and low covid vaccination in china is the  key to monitor
7/18/22, 6:17 PM - Vibhu: Sales data (and hence projected demand) doesn’t look bad at all. 
Inventory is the problem which can cause swings in short term.
7/18/22, 6:19 PM - Vibhu: It is contradictory statement when one says 
- market is going down because demand has weakened 
-  prices are going higher and labor market is short because people have free money
7/18/22, 6:35 PM - Padam Jain: Woow, that is a lot of interpretation from just one table
7/18/22, 8:11 PM - Padam Jain: Based on the YOY inventory, supply doesn't seems to be short either for the retail items either.
7/18/22, 8:39 PM - Sumit: How are you interpreting future outlook from backward looking (Q1’22) numbers?
7/18/22, 9:57 PM - Ashu: Inventory of high demand items is low, and there is glut of less popular/ wfh era products. Hence high inventory but empty shelves at the same time. (Toilet paper vs baby food formula for eg)
7/19/22, 9:58 AM - Padam Jain: Is it only empty shelve items that are more expensive? I feel like everything is expensive
7/19/22, 9:58 AM - Vibhu: Everything is expensive - oil
7/19/22, 9:59 AM - Padam Jain: and labor?
7/19/22, 9:59 AM - Vibhu: <Media omitted>
7/19/22, 9:59 AM - Vibhu: Yea labor too
7/19/22, 10:00 AM - Padam Jain: Makes sense.
Next 2-4 have heavy dependency on oil

7/22/22, 5:37 PM - Padam Jain: Waze is already there to sell on maps I think
7/22/22, 6:10 PM - Ashu: There are buy options for restaurants already on google maps
7/22/22, 6:10 PM - Ashu: Click on a place and in details page you will see a banner to order online
7/22/22, 6:12 PM - Ashu: Looks like restaurant specific 
Otherwise it connects to grubhub etc
7/22/22, 8:22 PM - Ashu: Question 
Any area with park/trees and restaurants in walking distance?

Eg rivermark plaza had a huge park next to restaurants. 

Looking for something closer

7/24/22, 4:09 PM - Padam Jain: I can bring my infinity. Anika can just use Evi car seat

I want to keep my phone cool so I can listen to guided meditation in the sauna. It's only 15 minutes. Does anyone have any ideas? I've found this but feels expensive?
7/27/22, 11:05 AM - Vibhu: Which headphones are you using (wired or Bluetooth) ? 
The temperature can affect the headphone also quite a bit. 
The watch and phone definitely shuts down if exposed
7/27/22, 11:05 AM - Vibhu: The hack which I have figured out is to take extra towel and wrap my phone inside towel.
7/27/22, 11:07 AM - Vibhu: Or I have sometime kept my phone outside sauna and use Bluetooth headphone  but worry about reliability and life of Bluetooth headphone
7/27/22, 11:30 AM - Vibhu: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20220721PD212.html?fsm=414a49f900d3ddbc
7/27/22, 11:35 AM - Leanne: Cheap wired set of headphones (bought at CVS for $5). So not valuable, but would want it to last at least a little
7/27/22, 11:36 AM - Leanne: The sauna at my gym doesn't lend itself well to safely leaving it outside
7/27/22, 11:36 AM - Leanne: I'll try the towel!
7/27/22, 11:40 AM - Vibhu: Another trick which can help is to get the towel barely wet in which you are folding phone. 

I do more that for my head. Wet towel covering my head so I can survive longer in sauna but should work for phone also.
7/27/22, 11:43 AM - Leanne: Will try! Thanks vibhu!
7/27/22, 2:12 PM - Vibhu: SPY up
7/27/22, 2:13 PM - Vibhu: If still worried about recession (😛), mid size companies or related ETF might be a good bet
7/27/22, 5:06 PM - Vibhu: How difficult or acceptable it is for sourcing managers to put invention disclosures and patent in your WorkEx /view ?
7/27/22, 8:49 PM - Ashu: Depends on area of course
7/27/22, 8:49 PM - Ashu: But quite rare
7/27/22, 11:04 PM - Vibhu: What’s bday boy plan?

7/28/22, 12:38 PM - Padam Jain: Zuckerberg seems to be very worried. He doesn't follow SPY 😜

7/29/22, 8:34 PM - Rashi: Tum agar bhi number aa gaya
7/29/22, 8:35 PM - Rashi: Tumhara*
7/29/22, 8:35 PM - Sumit: Haan all of us were positive including kids
7/29/22, 8:37 PM - Nila Le: Glad that you all are recovered!! Hope it was not too rough. Didn’t know. We could have dropped food off if we knew.
7/29/22, 8:39 PM - Padam Jain: Come to the bar area
7/29/22, 8:41 PM - Ashu: Were you able to guess how it got to you?
Office? Daycare? Pickle ball?
7/29/22, 8:41 PM - Ashu: Let’s see if we can find outdoor area to sit
7/29/22, 8:42 PM - Padam Jain: 40mins wait
7/29/22, 8:42 PM - Padam Jain: Go somewhere else?
7/29/22, 8:42 PM - Sumit: 🤷‍♂️ no idea .. most likely through kids
7/29/22, 8:44 PM - Sumit: No worries.. we did fine.. no strong symptoms except kids having fever couplr of times
7/29/22, 8:44 PM - Sumit: Glad viraaj was vaccinated with two dose and yuvi had one dose
7/29/22, 8:57 PM - Padam Jain: Ashu/Rashi walk to the back side
7/29/22, 9:00 PM - Rashi: We are sitting outside

7/29/22, 9:00 PM - Padam Jain: I don't know if they serve there

7/30/22, 7:42 PM - Rashi: Most likely they are trying to reach vibhu and they are unable to. So it is postponing. My guess
7/30/22, 7:42 PM - Ashu: Just like twitter acquisition, date keeps moving
7/30/22, 7:42 PM - Rashi: Haha
7/31/22, 7:58 AM - Ashu: Leaving Tuesday now 
Upgraded to biz for nominal fee, and now have extra luggage on outbound 🤷‍♂️ plus stroller check in. 

Padam’s dropping us, but we might need another car for luggage 😜
Anyone else free? Tuesday 10.30-11.30 round trip to sfo.
7/31/22, 9:29 AM - Sumit: How many bags do you have?

7/31/22, 10:32 AM - Vibhu: Can do
7/31/22, 10:36 AM - Nila Le: We might have 6-7 checked in luggages, including stroller+car seat, and 2 backpacks for carry on.

One of you can drive our car if that’s easier. Thank you 🙏
7/31/22, 10:38 AM - Nila Le: AM 😀
7/31/22, 10:41 AM - Vibhu: Would be ok.
7/31/22, 10:49 AM - Padam Jain: U-Haul rent ker le?
7/31/22, 10:52 AM - Nila Le: Rashi, Ashu suggests you order a Rivian truck instead of SUV
7/31/22, 10:52 AM - Nila Le: Did your Tesla arrive?
7/31/22, 10:58 AM - Padam Jain: Yeh, I also need to bring some compost once Rashi has the truck  😜

8/2/22, 12:04 PM - Ashu: We were almost there to need a third car 😜
Need a truck in group (nudge nudge Rashi)
8/2/22, 12:05 PM - Padam Jain: Glad you are all settled now. Have a good flight

8/2/22, 3:18 PM - Vibhu: You = iPhone ?
8/2/22, 3:25 PM - Rashi: Ashu how come you have stopped asking whom does Anika looks like? Have you done peace with the fact or have your own beliefs 🥹🤓
8/2/22, 3:41 PM - Padam Jain: She definitely has baby fat like Ashu
8/3/22, 2:09 AM - Ashu: I need to upgrade my iPhone soon
8/3/22, 2:10 AM - Ashu: Tokyo nrt transfer, no redoing security checks. Just gate transfer! Makes it even easier than tsa pre
8/3/22, 10:32 AM - Rashi: I told you not to get se :)
8/3/22, 10:32 AM - Ashu: Need you to release a touch-id photo soon!!
8/3/22, 10:33 AM - Rashi: Use your beautiful face 🤓
8/3/22, 10:33 AM - Rashi: And watch
8/3/22, 10:33 AM - Rashi: Actually most time I unlock with watch. Don’t even see towards phone
8/3/22, 10:34 AM - Ashu: Just got settled after arrival 
Reminds me of 2000s India (crowd/car density)
8/3/22, 10:34 AM - Ashu: 12.34am here
8/3/22, 10:35 AM - Rashi: Have fun!

8/3/22, 8:47 PM - Rashi: <Media omitted>
8/3/22, 8:49 PM - Ashu: Bay Area climate is unbeatable
8/3/22, 9:15 PM - Ashu: Makes for most delicious mangoes and guavas 😋
8/3/22, 9:18 PM - Nila Le: Which costs 10 cents (and delicious ) vs. $5 bad guava from aSJ store 😛
8/3/22, 10:54 PM - Ashu: Anika and I are not stepping out of AC yet 😁
8/4/22, 12:48 PM - Padam Jain: Sat. Late afternoon at my place? Ashu will also be back and he might want to enjoy his short lived freedom 🤣
8/4/22, 1:20 PM - Ashu: Someone needs to pick me from airport around noon
8/4/22, 1:20 PM - Padam Jain: I can do that unless Vibhu wants to go to office as well
8/4/22, 3:26 PM - Sumit: Coming on Saturday noon? How many cars you need?
8/4/22, 3:27 PM - Padam Jain: 😆
8/4/22, 3:29 PM - Sumit: Do you guys have any idea about discovery charter school? Viraaj got into the lottery so trying to figure out this option.
8/4/22, 4:51 PM - Padam Jain: No idea, Sumit.
8/4/22, 5:14 PM - Ashu: Let me check with NiLa’s friend
8/4/22, 6:11 PM - Sumit: 🙏 let me know by tomorrow morning whatver you find out. Looks like it got good ratings and of course avoids $25K/year fees of private schools (for one kid) 🤪
8/4/22, 6:21 PM - Ashu: That’s 25k pre year in post tax 😢
8/4/22, 6:21 PM - Ashu: <Media omitted>
8/4/22, 6:22 PM - Sumit: Yup 😭
8/4/22, 6:55 PM - Nila Le: She has not much idea but she heard good things about it.
8/4/22, 6:55 PM - Nila Le: Her kids go to Stratford (a charter school)
8/4/22, 7:02 PM - Sumit: Stratford is a private school, not a public charter.
8/4/22, 7:03 PM - Padam Jain: Why don't you try for one year. You can always move to private schools
8/4/22, 7:04 PM - Sumit: Yeah definitely inclining for discovery charter for that reason as it hards to get into lottery after kindergarten as there are less seats in higher grades.
8/4/22, 7:13 PM - Ashu: Also I heard that if one kid is in, easier to get second one in.
8/4/22, 7:14 PM - Ashu: They went through lottery so I assumed
8/4/22, 7:16 PM - Sumit: Yes 100% chance to get second kid in the K grade as second kid gets priority in lottery and number of empty seats are 100%
8/4/22, 7:18 PM - Sumit: Don’t think they have lottery. Viraaj got into straford after passing a test but it was even pricier than challenger school where he went for summer and planned to continue for K.
8/4/22, 7:21 PM - Vibhu: You can pay me half of the money, and I can reach yuvi
8/4/22, 7:21 PM - Vibhu: Teach*
8/4/22, 7:25 PM - Ashu: Okay now I really doubt my memory 🤦‍♂️
8/4/22, 7:26 PM - Ashu: Stratford Los Gatos
8/4/22, 7:43 PM - Nila Le: No, I confirmed her kids went to Stratford for preschool and it was through lottery. So it might be different systems for different levels? And my bad about charter vs. private — I might misremember
8/4/22, 7:46 PM - Sumit: 😄
8/4/22, 7:52 PM - Ashu: She will be best rock climber for sure!!
We will send Anika too
8/4/22, 9:07 PM - Rashi: Sumit I can teach her too second half of the money you can give it to me. I promise she will be good in maths
8/5/22, 7:11 AM - Nila Le: Happy birthday Shalini!! Any plans?
8/5/22, 7:11 AM - Ashu: Happy birthday!!
8/5/22, 9:43 AM - Rashi: Happy bday shalini!!

8/6/22, 10:53 AM - Ashu: Global entry doesn’t require scanning passport anymore??
Just took my picture and printed receipt with all correct details!
8/6/22, 10:53 AM - Ashu: Out in 10 seconds
8/6/22, 10:53 AM - Rashi: Yes. But they check when they collect receipt. It’s pretty fast now
8/6/22, 10:53 AM - Rashi: Eye scan
8/6/22, 10:54 AM - Rashi: Will be there
8/6/22, 11:00 AM - Ashu: Nothing, he just took the receipt, welcomed me home, and carried on with next passenger
8/6/22, 11:03 AM - Rashi: Effectively you can enter USA without passport 🤫
8/6/22, 11:08 AM - Ashu: If airline lets you board
8/6/22, 11:14 AM - Padam Jain: You just look so American. I think that's why
8/6/22, 3:36 PM - Padam Jain: Vibhu, let me know ETA. Will keep chai ready

9/14/22, 3:20 PM - Vibhu: He is one of the pioneer in early history of climbing in Yosemite

9/15/22, 10:57 AM - Padam Jain: एक इंजीनियर अपने बेड पर मच्छरदानी लगा कर लेटा हुआ था,
उसकी मच्छरदानी में एक छेद था।

मच्छर बार-बार उसके अंदर घुस जाते थे। इंजीनियर परेशान हो गया ।

उसने मच्छरदानी में एक छेद और किया और आर-पार उन दोनो छेदों में पाइप डाल दिया।

अब सारे मच्छर परेशान हैं। एक तरफ से घुसते हैं और दूसरी तरफ से निकल जाते हैं🤪

 Happy Engineers Day.

9/19/22, 10:13 PM - Ashu: Came for pain
Just got ct scan
Next steps depend on stone size
9/19/22, 10:14 PM - Padam Jain: I see.
9/19/22, 10:26 PM - Ashu: 2-3 mm stones
9/19/22, 10:26 PM - Vibhu: Plural ?
9/19/22, 10:27 PM - Ashu: Yes 2
2 & 2.5 maybe
9/19/22, 10:27 PM - Ashu: Out of kidney at bladder entrance
9/19/22, 10:27 PM - Ashu: Once in bladder they will pass easily
9/19/22, 10:28 PM - Rashi: So doctor will push it in bladder?
9/19/22, 10:28 PM - Vibhu: So you need more beer
9/19/22, 10:28 PM - Ashu: No, just fluids and painkillers
9/19/22, 10:28 PM - Rashi: Or scotch
9/19/22, 10:29 PM - Ashu: I haven’t had a coffee in over a week 😢
9/19/22, 10:29 PM - Vibhu: That’s exactly the description of beer
9/19/22, 10:29 PM - Ashu: Getting discharged shortly
9/19/22, 10:30 PM - Rashi: Or scotch (ask Jagjit Singh)
9/20/22, 7:05 AM - Leanne: So sorry Ashu that sounds awful 😔 hope it passes soon
9/20/22, 10:07 AM - Padam Jain: How will you know if it has passed or not? Regular CT scans?
9/20/22, 11:16 AM - Ashu: pissing in strainer to catch it 🥴
9/20/22, 12:54 PM - Padam Jain: Seriously?? Make sure you don't miss it in that case.
9/22/22, 10:33 AM - Padam Jain: No luck with stones yet?
9/22/22, 12:26 PM - Nila Le: Ashu thinks he passed one stone 😀 But he didn’t use a strainer so not 100% sure.
9/22/22, 12:30 PM - Sumit: Bummer .. a $10 strainer could have saved him thousand dollar of another CT scan 😜
9/22/22, 3:03 PM - Padam Jain: It ultrasound not able to catch this? Curious why CT is neede
9/22/22, 3:03 PM - Padam Jain: needed.
9/22/22, 3:04 PM - Padam Jain: Let us know when you "think" the second one has passed too. Need to celebrate it

9/23/22, 7:34 AM - Rashi: <Media omitted>
9/23/22, 8:28 AM - Sumit: Recession was always around the corner. The only thing ‘naysayers’ argued about was unemployment indicator but it has started to show signs and will show up in economy reports by January.
9/23/22, 10:51 AM - Vibhu: The FWD P/E is currently around 16~17 and the current PE for S&P is 19… so the street is expecting around 10 Percent growth in the earnings … it all depends how earnings pan out for the entire S&P 500. Lot of earnings coming out soon.
9/23/22, 10:51 AM - Vibhu: Sep/Oct generally is a lower tick on SPY
9/23/22, 11:06 AM - Padam Jain: Recession has more factors then just stock indices. Stock indices are the aftermath and not precursor

9/23/22, 11:15 AM - Vibhu: Nobody in the group cares about recession per se but the impact on stock market.  Yes I agree that stock market is looking forward.
9/23/22, 11:15 AM - Vibhu: That’s why next earning  will tell if we are in recession or in bubble of recession
9/23/22, 11:16 AM - Vibhu: I am inclined to bet that stock market will bounce back and will fluctuate between 375-425 as I have been saying for months
9/23/22, 11:16 AM - Padam Jain: I care. Everything is damn expensive and minimal external job opportunities
9/23/22, 11:17 AM - Padam Jain: Can't buy any investment property because interest rate is 7% now
9/23/22, 11:19 AM - Vibhu: You and I just changed job. 
And if you have cash to buy, stocks are cheap so buy them 😁.
9/23/22, 11:22 AM - Padam Jain: Well you don't care about the impact on the stock market either unless you need to liquidate them right now to buy something 😉
9/23/22, 11:23 AM - Padam Jain: Ashu, why are you all low level employees giving tough time to Sundar Pichai in All hand?

9/25/22, 4:21 PM - Nila Le: Hey Rashi! We’ll be there in 2 mins. If you haven’t left, could you bring some paper cups, a bottle opener, and a knife? 😀 We forgot to pack them.
9/25/22, 4:21 PM - Rashi: Sure!!
9/25/22, 4:21 PM - Rashi: Beer or wine opener?
9/25/22, 4:22 PM - Rashi: I may have to hunt for it 😂
9/25/22, 4:24 PM - Nila Le: Beer 🍺 😂
